The mill men on the coast say that stocks of lumber all over the world are badly in need of new supplies. If from the confidence engendered by the harvesting of a good crop, building resumes its former activity in the Prairie Provinces, and vessels are able to clear to newly developed markets in Great Britain, the West Indies, and the American Atlantic Coast States, they expect a business which will tax all their available facilities. In the meantime, it is shown that one mill in Vancouver is working overtime on new orders, which will keep it busy for a considerable period, and other lumber men are in daily expectation of orders for large quantities of building materials for reconstruction in Europe. There are evidences that the clear spruce of British Columbia is meeting with favor for the construction of aeroplanes, and several small supplies have been delivered.

There is much criticism of modern educations! methods that require too touch work of school children, allowing them too little time for play and preventing sufficient out-of-door exercise. When the study of music or sny ether accomplishment, with the necessary practice, Is added the strain Is Increased. Under these conditions the blood becomes impoverished and fails to nourish the nerves. The child becomes restless, and twitching of the muscles follow. Sometimes the child stumbles in walking and drops what It tries to hold. Pallor, listlessness And irritability are symptoms that early show that the blood and nerves are failing to meet the demands made upon them, and that St Vitus dance has fastened its hold upon the child.
In this condition there is no tonic can equal Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, which build up the blood, strengthen the nerves and safely help to meet the demands of the growing child. Out-of-door exercise, nourishing food, plenty of sleep with these tonic pills will cure even the most severe cases of St Vitus dance. We offer the following proof; "Up to the age of ten years,” says Mrs. Johnson, of Hem-ford, N.8., "my son Calvin was as healthy and rugged as any child could be. Then he began to complain that his eyes hurt him, and of pains in the head, and began to fall back in hie studies at school. Then I noticed a twitching of the muscles of his face and arms, and later his whole body seemed to be in constant motion. Our family physician was called in and pronounced the trouble a severe attack of St. Vitus dance. He was under the doctor's treatment for some three months, but did not seem to improve. We had taken him from school, and were careful that nothing should excite him, but notwithstanding he grew worse, and the least start would bring on attacks of hysteria, rhis went on for some months until Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills were brought to my attention, and we decided to give him this medicine. After using i few boxes there was a noticeable improvement, and by the time he had taken nine or ten boxes he had recovered his former good health. There has been no sign of a return of the trouble, and I can scarcely say how thankful we feel for the complete restoration o four eon’s health."
Parents who find their growing boys or girls becoming nervous should lose no time in giving them Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. You may ward off an attack of St Vitus dance, or if the trouble has reached that stage the Pills will effect a cure. Sold by all medicine dealers or by mail at 60 cents a box or six boxes for $2.60 from The Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Brockville, Ont.

Zinc is often the hardest thing in the house to clean, especially under kitchen stoves, where it becomes badly discolored. One of the simplest and surest methods is to dry thoroughly the zinc and then go over it with kerosene oil, which must be allowed to stand over night. In the morning this should be wiped with soft cloth, and more kerosene applied. The oil eats out all the grease and dirt which adheres to the zinc and makes it white and spotless. Zinc-lined sinks or bathtubs can be treated the same way, but must be thoroughly dried afterward.

Italians Use Bulls to Charge Defences.
Household Hints.
During the attack on the fortifications of Monte Corada, the Italians employed savage bulls, which were rushed against the barbed wire with their horns lowered. This novel method of attack was completely successful, and the infantry, following up, carried the fort which was being attacked. The garrison, after a short resistance, threw down their arms.

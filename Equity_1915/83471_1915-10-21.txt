Some days had passed since the viU lage had first been shaken by strange rumors that Captain Salter was thinking of getting married. First it was stated that Mrs. Jenkins was the favored lady. Then 'popular opinion swung round to Mi»» Larcombe.
On the third day the captain marched boldly up to the widow’s front door, and knocked.
“Good morning, captain,” said Mrs. Jènkins, trying to keep her voice steady. “How are you?”
“Very well, ma’am—very well/ replied the man bluffly. “I’ve come to thank you for giving me your advice about the wallpaper.”
“No, no,” protested the widow, with n blush, “it was your choice—and a very good choice, too!”
“Well, it’s hung now, and 1 wanted just to ask if you’d come in to tea this evening and have a look at it.”
The widow accepted in haste. Surely, now, surely, she told herself, he meant business!
Leaving her palpitating with anticipation, the captain walked away and then turned back furtively and sought the cottage on the other side. #
This time the curtains were the topic of conversation, but the same invitation was given.
Sharp on the stroke of four a knock at the captain’s front door. It

Drawers that open and shut with difficulty are often a severe tax on both time and temper# and the defect may sometimes be very easily remedied with beeswax. The runners, the narrow si. ips of wood attached to , the frame work, should be well rubbed with a lump of beeswax, previously warmed in front of the fire. Afterwards an occasional application of furniture polish will keep the run- ! ncrs smooth. When this simple remedy fails it is due to some fault in construction.

London, Eng., Sept. 22.—The principle that we should act under orders to the end of the war applies no less to the industrial than the military sphere. It applies to every department of national supply—to the agriculturist, to the transport worker, to the skilled factory hand, to the employer and his machines, to casual labor. The activities of 46,000,000 human beings can be co-ordinated and directed to a single end only through the impalpable cohesion which willing and loyal service gives. Discipline in essence is prompt and exacts obedience to orders. And in war time the nation, if it is to do its work properly, must, no less than the army, put itself under discipline.
But on the industrial plane it cannot be done by law. The Government cannot give orders to every individual as to how he should employ himself to the end of the war. National service in industry must be introduced primarily by public opinion, national unity of Germany or France, their efficiency and spirit, their subordination of all questions of person or class to the supreme business of war, is not due to statutes or to fear of punishment, but to a self-imposed national discipline, directed and encouraged by Government, but in its essence of popular origin. And in this country unity and efficiency will only come through national discipline similarly self-imposed. It is not until every worker, every employer, every farmer, resolves to do whatever will serve his country best in this the day of its trial, whatever it may cost, that we shall get efficient organization and inner peace.
This spirit is specially difficult to introduce in the industrial sphere. Unfortunately the war has caught the British Isles at the crisis of the struggle between capital and labor. Industry itself has become a sort of trench warfare in which positions are won or retained only after long and desperate fighting. In consequence, to a large proportion of the population duty to the State has been almost forgotten in the more pressing claims of duty to their class, denly another and more real war has intervened, with an imperative demand on both sides to abandon their strife and bend all their energies to increasing the output of supplies. This they have so far been unable to do. The ill-feeling between employ-

gun to recognize this truth in practice. We are spending more than the other nations and getting less. In another article the problem of economy is examined in greater detail.
Its conclusion, amounts to this, that we cannot assume that we shall be uble to last out the enemy unless wc get far more for our expenditure than we do to-day, and unless we effect ruthless economics in our private expenditure, especially on ported supplies.
The first aspect of the problem is mainly for the Government. They alone can decide where economies can be effected in our public expenditure.
Not the smallest Tause of waste is the prevailing idea that everybody and every locality has a right to make much profit as they can out of the tremendous outlay of public money that is now going on. That idea is quite inconsistent with any true principle of national service. If national service were carried into universal effect everybody would country for a living wage to their own standard of living, till the end of the war. But while any such drastic revolution as that is out of place in the middle of war, some steps can be taken towards it. Large

For the past six months the revenue has totalled $73,243,514.69, or an average of $12.207,262.44 a month. What that means may be better understood when It is remembered that the total revenue for the previous fiscal year, four months of which were anti-bel-lum. was $133,073,481.73, the monthly c average thus being lower than the - average for the present year.

Canada's Part
The part that the Dominion of Canada could play In a struggle such as this was probably underesti* mated by the friends of Britain as It undoubtedly was by her enemies. That Canada has done so much more than was expected of her is due to the fact that there was In the Dominion wh* n the need arose, a man of com-Bu nding strength and courage clothed ability and the determination to give the fullest expression of the de- ,i desire of the Canadians to share In the struggle upon the Issue of which depends the integrity of every British nation.	*
Kir Robert Borden was born in 1854 at Grand Pre, the little Acadian villi Longfellow has made immortal. The Borden homestead Is there, being occupied by Mrs. e Borden, mother of the Prime Minister, until her death early In the pr sent year. The Bordens were United Empire Loyalists, and the strain is just as strong to-day in Sir Robert Borden as it was in his great grandfather who joined the stream of New England Loyalists and settled in King’s County in 1760.

A Way to Test It When There Is No Pressure Gauge Handy.
Time was when every tire manufacturer warned all and sundry to inflate their tires to a high degree of pressure, and more probably than not this was Jue to the fact that in those days all pumping was done by hand and with very inefficient implements.
The correct thing to do nowadays, of course, is to consult a standard table of requisite pressures, according to the tizc of tire and the load to be carried, and to use this in conjunction with a reliable gauge.
Fut t lie re is also a rough and ready method which Is by no means indeterminate if no pressure gauge is handy, and that is to take the car out on to a dry road which is in a had state of repair and full of holes. Preferably there should be no passengers on the rear scats. If the driving wheels are pumped up too hard the driver will experience a constant sensation of incipient skidding. and though he may not actually side slip, he will not find the car by any means easy to steer.
This is evidence that the tires are so j hard that they are humping over ob- j stades instead of absorbing them without leaving the ground.-New York | World

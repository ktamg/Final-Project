and should be handled very carefully. They should be stored immediately after being raised, in a cool but not too dry place. Where a g<H*l root cellar is available it is advisable to store them there, if possible in a standing position, and surrounded in peat soil, or moist sand. Otherwise it is better to store them in an outside pit on well-drained ground. The pit is made about 6 feet wide, and the roots are piled up 3 feet high with slanting sides, so that the covering material will not slide down. After piling, the pit is immediately covered with a thin layer of straw, just enough to keep a 4 inch layer least 250 yards. Swedes and turnips require a greater distance.

This illustration, from a German paper, has a special interest affording an instance of the painstaking care the enemy take to con ce a I their positions of importance. The locality is stated to be m the Western war theatre.” In order to create a background tor the trenches at that point, and to serve as a screen for something else behind, in all likelihood a battery of big guns, a sparsely growing copse « f straggling fir trees on the spot has been artificially thickened h\ transplanting fir poles and trunks brought from elsewhere in t n neighborhood. The result of the process is to produce the appearance at a short distance of a dense, close-set wood of growing tns inter spersed with larches which are naturally bare m winter.

Potato Meal in Bread-Making.
Raking experiments to test the value of making bread of potato meal mixed with wheat flour are being undertaken by the United States Department of Agriculture’s Bureau of Chemistry This is to test the possibilities of the potato in the same manner as Germany and Austria are now advising their people to do. The in creased cost of living throughout the world has emphasized the fact that flour made of other substances than wheat, or of these substance# mixed with wheat, might provide people with healthful food quite as nutritious as the pure wheat flour, and at the same time cheaper.
Austrian bakers are now compel led by law to use at least 30 pet cent, potato meal in making their bread. The Bureau of Chemistry s potato meal bread has been baked with from 25 to 50 per cent, potato-meal, and the remaining percentage wheat. The most satisfactory loaves in combining economy and appearance were those made with the minimum percentage allowed in
The loaves mad* with more than 30 per cent, potato meal were not so satisfactory, aa they were heax icr and less attrac live in form. The bread has a rather coarse texture and dark ap pearance, but possesses a distinc live and agreeable flavor. It also retains moisture for a much longer period than ordinary wheat bread.
The Bureau of Chemistry used the imported “potato flake in some experiments, and in other* meal made by slicing, milling and drying potatoes on a small scale in its laboratories. It should be added that such ordinary flour” as is on our À me roan mar keta it not the same as the Ger man which
results in the experiments.
The question has been raised at to whether the ordinary cooked potato might not be satisfactorily substituted for the prepared pots

14When she had gathered her feet as close together as she could she sprang for the pile of leaves. She landed In the very middle of the pile and gave several long, wicked rakes with her hind feet Then she began to smell and scratch In the leaves.

Military Hospitals Do Not Kill Them mo In the Old Days.
Busily two-thirds of tbo pain and suffering endured by tbo wounded In war Is not due to tbs wounds thorn-jolvea or to tbo process of bottling, but lo suppuration and Infection, and all this has boon absolutely wiped out by antiseptic surgery.
What military hospitals wore like In the pro antiseptic days beggars description and can hardly eveu be Imagined,
I let alone believed, at the present day.
Marlborough's surgeon In the famous Uleuhelm campaign declared that hospitals were the most Important cause of death. And a famous French surgeon In 1741 declared that he had known vastly more men to die In the hospitals from lack of care than to lose their lives In combat, and that “hospitals are an unfathomable gulf; the source of their horrors appears to be Inexhaustible.” Two patients In each bed was the rule and often three or even four. The hospitals were literally breeding places for disease. The deadly typhus fever used to be known as hospital fever, while typhoid, dysentery, erysipelas and gangrene fairly ran riot In them. Browning's charms-tertzatlon of the medieval hospital as “that good house that helps the poor to die” was painfully accurst*
Even as late as our wsr betw states, when the dreaded hospital gangrene once put In an appearance In a ward It was a sentence of death to be sent Into that ward with an open wound, and In some Instances from 40 to 00 per cent of all the Inmates actually died. Up to and Indeed during the Napoleonic wars anywhere from 20 to 00 per cent of the wounded died. Today any army medical service that loses more than 0 to 0 per cent of Its wounded considers Itself disgraced.—Woods Hutchinson In Saturday Evening Post
How Do You Suppose It Is Verbally Drown by Your Friondef | Did you ever experience the sensation of hearing yourself physically described by another who did not happen to know that you were within earebotl If so, you may have beard yourself pictured as “that short legged mar with the ecraggly gray mustache, you know."
You may have been pained or uluui ed. it all depend* upon your sense oi humor or the tituvss of things. Bui do not despair ut your portrait Just listen some time to a pair of men when one of them Is trying to recall to his companion a third Individual, the latter seen perhaps only once years age by the auditor. The gentleman Jogging the other man’s memory Is likely to sketch the absentee In a few bold strokes something like the following:
“Oh, sure, you remember him—the fellow with long yellow teethl U« parted his hair near his ear, and he had a scar on his chin.”
“Now, I do,” cheerfully replies the other at this piece of graphic description and then adds his own touch, “He was with a little chap who stuttered and wore big spectacles of tortoise shell.”
And the Interesting question It brings up Is, Why do people, generally speak-tog, remark defects and singularities rather than perfections and beauties! ? man with long yellow teeth might have had fine eyes and a noble head set upon hi» shoulders, and a begoggled chap with a stammering tongue might have had a Greek profile and an artist’s hands.
We are assured that beauty is everywhere, yet people seem to take par tlcular note of the ugly. No doubt It Is easier to see the ugly than the beautiful In humanity, but why take the easier way 7—New York Sun.

SAVE YOUR HEART.
BORN A FIGHTER.
Don't Crowd Extra Work Upon It, a# It Has Enough to Do.
Heart strain may be brought on by many common, thoughtless actions of everyday life, ns, for Instance, running to catch a train. In on actual experiment made on a person with a healthy heart before the run the heart rate was seventy-six per minute and the heart was doing 152 foot pounds of work a minute; after the run the heart rate was 180 and the heart was doing 30C foot pounds n minute, an Increase of 228 foot pounds. Great strain may alsc be Imposed upon the heurt by ascend Ing stairs hurriedly.
Not only physical exertion, but emotions, affect the heart “Keep your temper” Is good medical advice, for when a person is angry the work his heart does may be Increased as much as seventy two foot pounds a minute Even after the emotion or exertion bas ceased the heart continues to do ex tra work for some time before It gets back to Its normal rate The amount of extra work the heart can do Is surprising. Tests have shown that in riding a bicycle nt a rapid pace up a 10 per cent grade for half a mile the extra work Imposed on the heart would be sufficient to lift one and one eighth tons one foot There are various ways by which we might save the heart work. As the heart beats less rapidly when we arc at rest we could save It 870,000 fool pounds of work a year by going to bed two hours earlier every night Lying down half an hour dally would mean an annual saving of 219,000 foot pounds; an hour’s rest every Sunday would save 02,400 foot pounds, and by staying In bed nil day Sunday the annual saving would be nearly a million foot pounds.—Detroit Free Press.
SYNOPSIS OF CANADIAN NORTHWEST LAND REGULATIONS
A French General Whe Loved Hie 6el«
diere end Proved It Many men have been good soldiers and brave commanders who, nevertheless, had no relish for fighting. General Oudlnot, famous In the wars of Napoleon, was a warrior of another type. He seemed, at all events, to love war for Its own sake. His fiery temper and his Ideal of a soldier are well exemplified In the following:
In July, 1806, when Oudlnot was thirty-eight years old, the emperor reviewed the grenadiers at their camp at Boulogne. The customary maneuvers were performed, and at the end General Oudlnot, In command of the grenadiers, started to march at the head of the line before Napoleon. He put the spurs to his horse, and the steed balked. The struggle was brief, for the exasperated general drew his sword and gave the horse such a stab In the neck that In another moment tbo horse lay stretched upon the sand.
That night the commander of the grenadiers dined with the emperor, and In the course of the meal Napoleon <uld:
"I# that the way you treat your horses ?'
“8lre,” said Oudlnot “when any one knows not how to obey that Is my method.”
The other story Is even more grim. Some one spoke to Oudlnot about the deep affection which a general must cherish for his devoted troops.
“Love them!” he exclaimed. “Do I love them? Ah, I think I do. I have had them all killed !"
There spoke the born fighter, who shirked no danger himself, and accounted It the most enviable lot of a solder to die on the field.—Washington Star.

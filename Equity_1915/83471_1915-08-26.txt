Uis U Attending to His Royal Duties
With Tact and Wisdom.
The following from the New York World, which has never been prone to say complimentary things about British royalty, is as significant as it is interesting:
While the British statesmen are making shreds and tatters of each other's reputation in their public quarrels. King George goes quietly on his way attending to the duties of his position, “playing the game" as far ns he himself is concerned with great discretion and wisdom. His popularity with his subjects has wonderfully increased accordingly, which is all the more remarkable because it was only in March, 1914, that the House of Commons witnessed an outburst against the sovereign, led by the Radical and Labor members, which had not been known there for nearly a century. It was at the time of the Ulster crisis.	1

Td call it the “pocket Paris” now woul<( be a travesty upon the Paris of to* day, clad in mourning garments, somv bre and sad of countenance.
The new Queen, formerly Princes! Marie of Edinburgh, the granddaughV ter of the Russian Czar Alexander IÎ; and the English Queen Victoria, has at last the chance to remodel the Bus charest court after her own ideasj which would make the capital as charming as Paris, as sumptuous as P^trograd, as riotous as Monte Carlo,' and as important to diplomacy and society as London.
The most distinguished statesmen in Europe have given Bucharest a, great deal of their attention during^ the past year, playing the game fori Rumania's neutrality or for her pars ticipation in the war upon one or the other side. Money has been sent inJ to the country from mysteriou^ sources and everybody seems to have plenty to spend upon the pleasures! of life.

Just before his death two weeks ago an unsigned letter was recei ved by the late Thus Murray, in which the wtiter pleaded pathetically for forgiveness for having stolen a large sum of money from Mr. Murray years ago. The writer had heard that Mr. Murray was nearing death, and he himself was quite ill and he wanted an expression of forgiveness before death came to either of them. He >rofesses repentance, declaring li in self very sorry for the wrong he had done, but unable financially to pay Lack the a mount stolen.
“Please let The Observer man know,” he said in conclusion, you will forgive this |toor thief, neither side, and I will know if you get this	_
letter.” The lettei i «• icfied Mr.

forgiveness was extended.—Pembroke Observer.

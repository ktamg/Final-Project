“Retiring” on the Karin.
There is no business in the world so delightful as farming when you do not get too much of it. Leisure on the farm is a joy. To walk out over the broad acres and watch the growing things, be they animal or vegetable, is always pleasing.
The city man looks longingly forward to the time when he can move to the “old farm and make it his home.
The city man who buys a farm and moves to the country seldom makes a mistake. But for the farm er to move to town in the hope of finding rest is an illusion, tragic and terrible, not only for the man him se lif hut for his family, the farm and for the community.

INFERIOR LIGHTNING R<*)8.
I

MPM
Prof. W. H. Day, B A., professeur | of physic# in Ontario Agricultural College, Guelph, » write# to warn the farmers of Ontario again*t inferior lightning rode. One of the same companies that buncoed the fanners with iron centred rod# last year is reported to be selling the same rod again thie year. Watch out for them.
There is no difficulty in spotting these rode. The outside covering is a thin sheet of copper. Inside of the copper is a strip oA galvaaiized steel or iron one-half inch wide and two galvanized «.teed or iron wires about No. 10. The copper slieath is twisted around the strip and wires, giving the rod a corrugated appearance. The steel or iron will rust out in from five to ten years. For photograph of what happened to a rod of this kind in lees than eight years sec Figure 34, Bulletin 280, which may be had by writing the Department of Agriculture, Toronto.
An Illinois firm is circularizing the trade and others advocating the “Mast” lightning rod system. They declare that twisted cab lea are positively dangerous, claiming they act like “choke-coils, ” that tubes only should bo used, that insulators must be used, eta^ Foi concentrated essence of error those circulars surpass anything else I have seen.
Beware of the man with the iron-centred rod and the man who claims that twisted cables are dangerous. This Department will be glad to be informed regarding the ope fat ion# of either.

Women Aid in Policing London While Regular “Bobbies" are at the Front.
While many of the regular London policemen are serving in the trenches at the front, their plates have been taken by women, just as women have succeeded to the other work of man in most of the countries now at war. The picture shows three female “Bobbies” on parade, receiving instruction* from an inspector. So far, the feminine custodians of the peace have proved very efficient and have done their duty quite as well as the men had done it in the past.
French Omelet
A well-known professor declares that there are few diseases which cam not Iw cured or alleviated by the music of an organ judicially applied . "The person taking the treatment.” he says, “is extended at full length on a cot supported by wooden rods and placed between the organ pi|»e» ; and selection#» are played to suit the one taking the treatment. ' The cure is effected by the vibration of the cot under the influence of the organ pipes.

The Intimate Friend.
Feasibly there are few families to whom the pleasure of an intimate friend is unknown. She may be a middle-aged woman who, lacking the joy of a family of her own, takes a loving motherly interest in the boys and girls of an old school friend between herself and whom there is a strung affinity and affectum. She may be a young girl, merry enough to be an entertaining friend to those of her own age and sufficiently sympathetic, homely, and conversational to make a kind and charming deputy daughter when the occasion demands.
Or she may be a married woman, living near enough to these chief friends of hers to make it possible to spend a fair amount of time with them without neglecting her home or children.
But whoever she may be. the intimate friend, if sfhe be of the right kind, is invariably a source of happiness in the family. If a day is dull or lacking in event there is always the knowledge or hope that she will run in if only /or a quarter of an hour to bring news and interest from her home or the outside world, to sympathize and give ad vice, to help decide some much-debated point, or to suggest a game for the younger children who have exhausted mother’s ideas.

The Truth At Last.
A San Francisco clergyman recently at the close of his sermon announced that in the course of the week he expected to go on a mi%aion to the heathen. One of the parishioners exclaimed, “Why, my dear doctor, you have never told us one wjrd of this before. It leaves m unprepared, what shall we do?” “Brother,” said the minister, solemnly, “1 shall not leave town."

Shrapnel was originally the name of t British general who, about a bun-?red years ago, was begging the board f ordnance of hi* native land for some ubstnntlnl recognition In respect of he new and deadly missile be had ?laced absolutely at tbelr service and vns being told tbn^thc Institution in iuestloa ' had no funds at Its disposal or the reward of merit/'
Henry Shrapnel's Invention was ?robably first employed at Surinam In 80* and was then '‘favorably report'd on," but eleven years Inter Sir Jeorge Wood, who commanded the nr-illery at Waterloo, declared that hrapnel had won that famous battle, without It, Wood asserted, no effort of ho British could have recovered the urmhouse of La Haye Salute.
In 1814 the government granted Shrapnel a pension of £1,200 a year ’or life, but this was interpreted by ils paymasters to covér all the inventons Shrapuel had given to the army, Deluding an Ingenious gun mounting thereby the recoil was utilized to irlng one gun Into action at the same Jme as another was put under cover, ibropnel was thus placed at a disadvantage, though he bad the eatlsfac-ion of drawing his pension to a ripe >Id age.

Ideas of the sport than the Maltese. Once a year the road skirting S lie ms = harbor is reserved as a race course, and the people turn out in thousands. The-p is no regulation of the course. The- crowd simply clears out of the way as the horses come along.
The Jockeys ride without bridles or saddles, and each carries a whip in either hand—one for his own mount, the other to keep bock any horse which may try to overtake him. We saw one of the spectators deliberately trip a horse up by putting his leg out, st grave risk to himself.
These things, however Incredible as they seem to sportsmen In this country, arc taken as quite a matter of course, and consequently hardly a year goes by without a fatality of some kind. All things considered. It Is not likely that the “go as you please" rules of this Maltese derby are likely to commend themselves to other turf authorities.—Wide World Magazine.

Quicksilver. «
The ore from which quicksilver Is obtained Is a brilliant red rock known ts cinnabar. When of high purity it is actually vermilion In color. Cinnabar Is the original source of the pigment known commercially as vermilion. It Is a compound of sulphur and quicksilver, and In order to separate the latter from the sulphur the rock Is roasted. Passing off In the form of a gas, the mercury is afterward condensed and flows out In a fine stream, like a continuous pencil of molten mil-AC* ver. Like gold and silver, mercury is occasionally found In a native or pure Sometimes the miner’s pick _ penetrates a cavity that contains a cupful or more of the elusive and beau, tiful fluid.

MES HOLDEN McCREADY LIMITED, Canada’s largest shoe manufacturers, supplied, within thirty-three days, 32,217 pairs of leather ankle boots and 30,000 pairs of canvas shoes for the outfitting of the First Canadian Contingent, the largest quantity supplied by
an> manufacturer.
These boots were worn by our soldiers on active service both in this country and in the training camps in England. They were subjected to the most severe usage that hoots could he subjected to. They travelled over rough roads and smooth. They waded through mud and through slush past all description. They were soaked by the never-ceasing rains of an abnormally wet English winter. They were baked on hot stoves, grilled on steam radiators and roasted before open fires. Yet, THEY STOOD THE TEST.
Out of the entire 32,217 pairs of leather boots supplied by this company only a single pair was shown to be open to criticism when the Government enquiry was made six months later.
been amply corroborated by numerous reports and letters received from officers and soldiers at the front all testifying to the good wearing qualities of the Ames Holden McCready boots.
• • •
When the question was rsi • ,i concerning the quality of the Canadian soldiers’ boots, Ames Holden McCready Limited placed themselves IMMEDIATELY upon record, by writing to the Government, as desirous of having the most thorough investigation of the matter. The appointment of a Parliamentary Committee and the official enquiry followed. It occupied several weeks' time. The Committee stopped at nothing In their efforts to get at all the facts.
This Company pu* based the best leather and supplies available in Canada and spared no expense in manufacturing the hoots. All our Invoices, and shop and manufacturing records were produced before the Parliamentary Committee tor their inspection and information. We had nothing to hide and were proud of the boots which were furnished to the Government.
THE AMES HOLDEN McCREADY BOOTS CAME OVT OF THE ORDEAL UNSCATHED.
The Committee reported to Parliament that the hoots supplied by this company substantially complied with the sample, that no paper or other fraudulent substances had been employed in their manufacture and that all charges Involving the Integrity of this company or of the boots supplied by them had been abundantly dlsproven by the sworn evidence taken before the Committee.
The report, which was adopted by Parliament, was A COMPLETE VINDICATION FOR AMES HOLDEN McCREADY LIMITED.
# # # #
In bringing these facts prominently before the people of the Dominion, Ames Holden McCready Limited arc actuated by the desire not only to protect their own good name — which needs no vindication with the thousands of Canadians who are familiar with this company and its products — but also that of a notable and important Canadian industry, which has been unwarrantably aspersed.

Exports employed by the Government examined 1365 pairs and 348 odd boots made by various manufacturers. Among the number were found only seven pairs of boots of Ames Holden McCready manufacture, of which five were found to be repairable, one pair unrepairable. and ONE PAIR HAD A SOLE UNDER GAUGE.
The best proof of the durability and serviceability of the Ames Holden McCready boots, however, wab afforded by the sworn statements of soldiers who had worn these boots constantly from the time they were issued in September, 1914, right through to March, 1915. They swore that they had worn the boots through all the rough experiences at Valcar-tier and on Salisbury Plain and that they had given excellent service throughout Sergeant Nussey, of Toronto, who had served twelve years In the British Army, appeared before the Committee with a pair of such boots still on bis feet and submitted them to the committee's inspection.

A Polish magnate living in the Government of Suwalki, Poland, about two and a half miles from the East Prussian frontier, lost his fortune, which compelled him to sell his 16,000-acre estate some four | ears ago.
It was thought some other local dignitary would purchase the property, which was adorned with an ancient mansion, but at the sale, a stranger, who gave his name as K lei sen berger, surprised all bidders by running the price up $350,000, which he paid in cash.
The new owner soon transformed his estate by a lavish expenditure of money. He appeared particularly addicted to landscape gardening. He constructed new buildings, improvised mounds and little chains of hills, he installed an elaborate system of irrigation ditches, put in many wine cellars and capped it all by erecting a massive tower.
The article continues that when the war began it suddenly developed that his wonderful garden was nothing more or less than a German fortress. The mounds were for heavy guns, the wine cellars for the storing of armament and ammunition, and the irrigation ditches were perfectly arranged trench es for the German soldiers. It took two weeks for the Russian troops to reduce and capture this floral fortification, and it cost many lives There was an elaborate system 4 wireless, and wire communication from the tower, which w

Information received at Grand Trunk Pacific headquarters at Moot-real recently from the British Columbia Government shows that the coast province has made preparations to welcome thousands of cultivators. Though final figures for 1914 demonstrate that 1,963 land pre-emptions were taken up In the nevly opened districts of the province during the year. This figure will show a large Increase, It Is expected, before 1915 dores, for the Government states that there are about 1,500,000 acres of surveyed land ready f>r the set-vl tier along the line of the Grand ; Trunk Pacific Railway, and tracts of ' • ! 160 acres can be taken possession of on payment of a record fee of 21, on Of the surveyed lands available to settlers, there are 140,913 acres In ipoijthe Cassiar land district, with 44P,. 000 acres in the coast district. In the Cariboo district the available sur- | veyed lands total 789,752 acres, the greater portion of which Is along the line of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, or tributary to the railway, the eastern half of the railway .through the province being within the con* ; fines of the Cariboo district.

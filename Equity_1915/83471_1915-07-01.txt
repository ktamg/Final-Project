I In addition to a higher per cent off No. Vi a share of the flrata on the thinned trees were fancy and would therefore sell for more money than ordinary No. l's. Another benefit of the thinning is its effect on the crop for another year. It is generally re* cognized that thinning the fruit in heavy crop years promotes annual bearing in trees that ordinarily bear biennially. The strength of the apple tree is used up, not In producing so much “apple sauce/’ but in the production of the seed. In the above experiment it was found that the re moval of 66 per cent, of the young apples made no difference in the total yield. That means that the applet left, on the average, grew to doublt the size of the fruit on unthinned trees, producing just as many barrels of apples, and the trees had to mature only half as many individual fruits, thus conserving energy and food material for another season.
Thinning is best done when the apples are about the size of walnuts. The earlier it is done the better start the fruit receives. Also the stems of young apples break off easier when young than when later, so that fewer ! fruit spurs are pulled from the tree. Thin the apples to from four to six inches apart, removing all small, misshapen or injured fruits. d)o not be afraid of taking too much fruit off. Usually too much is left on. One apple to a spur is a good rule to follow. The apples should not touch one another when full grown.
Thinning produces a higher per cent, of No. 1 fruit. A high per cent of No. l’s means less labor in picking, grading and packing, because the fruit is larger and there are less culls to grade out. Thinned apples will sell better because the results of experiments shows that they average better color. Add thinning to your list of orchard operations.

! cultural methods should watch care-j fully the practice of intensive farm-I ing by a settlement of Belgian refu-| gees, who have come to Ontario and may be located in the Niagara Peninsula. Belgium, as a farming country, was, until devastated by war, very densely populated. Labor was therefore abundant and cheap. Much of the soil of Belgium lends Itself naturally to intensive cropping, The home market in a thickly peopled country is a profitable one to the grower of farm produce, and the short distance across the North Sea to Great Britain makes the British market available for surplus products. Nowhere in Ontario can such conditions be found, and therefore the intensive farmer must depend very largely on facilities for export to the United States. These considerations go to show that the experiment above mentioned should be conducted with a great deal of caution.

Fire Hill Indians “Do Their Bit."
It will Interest many to know that enthusiasm for the cause of Great Britain at the present time is not confined to our white citizens. The Indians of the Fire Hill Agency, miles north of Belcarres, Saskatchewan, are an example to many of paler complexion. Most of the work on this reserve Is done by the younger Indians settled in a portion of the Agency set apart for ex-pupils of the Government schools. These young settlers are good farmers and thirty of them on a section known as "Colony" raised 100,000 bushels of wheat in 1913. In 1914, despite a drought which affected their sec,	| tion, the yield was nearly 50,000
bushels. Of their own free will these young people subscribed to the patriotic fund quantities of wheat and oats which, when sold by the Indian agent, Mr. William Graham, realized $502, an average of about $15 for each young farmer. Two of them have also Joined the second contln-

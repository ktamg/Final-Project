GREAT EFFICIENCY OF BRITISH FLEET

To come out and fight would be to court certain destruction; so almost the entire fleet, not only of capital ships, but a matière is a splendid appreciation of j°r*ly of the small cruisers and de-the contribution of the British navy «troyers, were hastily withdrawn into to the cause of the allies in the great the shelter of the Kiel Canal or into war.

The evacuation of Poland was decided upon by Russia in 1910, declares the Rusaky Invalid, the Russian military organ, in a discussion of the general staff’s before-the-war plans for the defence of the western frontier.

It can was unpreventable by the British protect the movement of troops by because the German Government has sea and occasionally co-operate with rendered access to that inland sea im-them. It can guard its own seaports Possible by mining the waters of the against attack and its coasts from in-1 international straits between Denmark vasion. It can render the seas of the world measurably safe for the commerce of its own country and it can destroy the commerce of the enemy.
These are the possibilities and the high duties of a great war fleet. It will be observed that we have not specified among them the obligation to seek out, fight, and destroy the enemy's fleet. This, in modern war, is purely a means to an end—the end being the execution of the four objects above recited. In this the canon of soa warfare differs from that of the land. An army must fight. It must seek contact with the enemy’s forces and must put forth all its energies to defeat and destroy them. It la only in this way that war can be carried to a decision. On the contrary, the naval power of one belligerent may be fully exerted without a battle. If it can effectively suppress the activities of the enemy’s navy without an engagement the purpose of its existence is fulfilled and it is not only justified in avoiding exaggerated risk to force an encounter under a serious handicap, but it is obliged by all considerations of wisdom and prudence to place its aafety above all craving for glory and renown.

resources, would turn their attention first of all against Russia. To frustrate this plan it was decided in 1910 that tha Russian territory jutting into Germany and the fortified places west of Brest-Litovsk should not be organized for a state of war. The region further east was chosen for the concentration of the Russian forces.
> < ' .4











and Sweden, while Denmark guards by guns and mines the neutrality of the channels which lie wholly within her territory. It is here proper to say that no reproach to German courage or German seamanship is involved in this withdrawal of the fleets to safe cover. Any other course would have been sheer insanity. Safe and ready to take advantage of any accident, they are still a potential force in the war of considerable importance.


Depth an Advantage.
"It would have been dangerous to attribute too great an importance to and to have held on the Narew and Vistula, with their fortified towns. II is better to take advantage of th< depth of our theatre of war to draw the German armies far from their base and to force them to exhaust I themselves. To this end it wai necessary to sacrifice the Polish salient. Three months have elapsed since the Russian army started to put this plan into execution. Constant marching, fighting and privations weaken the enemy. There are already evidences that the moral force of the German army is weakening in its attack, and prisoners confirm that this weakening is not only moral, but physical.
"This war will be decided by the armies in battle, and it is of no importance where this battle will take place. Thus our retreat assures us victory, for our armies are only now beginning to develop,	while an
abundance of munitions of war awaits us in the near future, thanks to the *1 mobilization of the national industry,
I and to the orders placed abroad, whereas for the moment the enemy is in a favorable position in this regard.
Not Wasting Garrisons.
"A glance backward shows that at the beginning of the war tfye Germans threw the mass of their army against France. This leap forward on their part had happy results for us, for we advanced into enemy territory notably in Galicia; now the tables are turned. However, it is impossible to hamper the liberty of movement of the Russian army in any particular region or on any particular frontier, and it would be impracticable to waste garrisons in defending fortified towns which are none too safe, as the Austrians did in Przemysl. That is why, examining, after a year of war, the map of the Russian front, we see the necessity for the living Russian armies to manœuvre and deploy on their base line. This would be the most useful object to aim at especially in view of the situation which has prevailed since the month of April.
Wearing Out the Enemy.
"At the present time we have against us nearly all the German cavalry, nearly all the Austrian army and more than half of the total German forces^about 70 divisions—and the enemy artillery has numerous guns of all calibres. The Russian army is offering a heroic resistance; it is not only standing up under the most hellish fire, but it is inflicting countless losses upon the enemy, and wearing him out, notwithstanding his technical perfection. We are getting nearer to our supplies of ammunition, by means of which we will correct our lines and throw back the enemy. If only for this reason we can say that the evacuation of Warsaw, the line of the Vistula-Ivangorod-Novo-Georgievsk will make certain that the Russian offensive this time will be definite and irresistible.
“Russia has the most definite plana for the issue of the campaign, while maintaining at the same time th< firm resolution to wage this fight tc a victorious end. '

An Unrealized Hope.
The German hope at the outset, of course, was to reduce the British superiority by surprise attacks. Admiral von Tirpitz has expressly favored this program. It was hoped that the British might be taken a wares and that by daring torpedo dashes sufficient big ships might be destroyed to bring the opposed fleets to some sort of parity. It so happened that the sudden peril of war found England at a most favorable moment. The entire naval force had recently been assembled for manœuvres, the greatest armada1 ever brought together had been reviewed by King George at Spithead on July

Hypnotic Power In Animale.
An Interesting instance of the hypnotic power possessed by a good many animals Is given by a correspondent of the Glasgow Herald.

The Equity learn* with much
regret of the death of Mr. Duncan Stevenson, whose illness was briefly mentioned in our last issue. The sad event occurred aInmt midnight Sunday, from some internal malady, which had been afflicting him for some time past. He was in his 73rd year, and was one of the oldest residents of the section in which he lived. His remains were interred in the Presbyterian cemetery near Campbells Bay on Tuesday afternoon. To the bereaved family and relatives we pffer our deepest sympathy.

Mr. G. B. Campbell, M. L. A., although sitting in the “cold shades of opposition" at Quebec, lias been enabled, nevertheless, to do a good deal for his constituents that the public in general know little about. Mr. Campbell, of course, is not of the kind the housetops and crow about it, and so a friend in one of the rear townships, who ap|»eai*s to know whereof lie speaks, considers that
wÈËH Campbell publicly recognized. This |tarty affirms that last year our local member procured colonization grants for several parties lx>th in Leslie and Thorne, and this year additional grants have been pi*o-enred. It seems to us that parties so favored are withholding justice from Mr. Campbell by not making a publie acknowledgment of what he has done for them.

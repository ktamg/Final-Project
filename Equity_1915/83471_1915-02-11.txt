There is Trouble Ahead.
Constantly on their feet, attending i f 1 to the wants of a large and exacting ^ family, women often break.down with nervous exhaustion.
In the stores, factories, and on a farm are weak, ailing women, dragged down with the torturing backache and bearing down pains.
Such suffering isn't natural, but it's dangerous, because due to diseased kidneys.
The dizziness, insomnia, derated menses and other symptoms of kidney complaint can’t cure themselves, they require the assistance of Dr. Hamilton's Pills which go direct to the seat of the trouble.
To give vitality and power to the kidneys, to lend aid to the bladder ami liver, to free the blood of poisons, probably there Is no remedy so successful as Dr. Hamilton's Pills. For all womanly irregularities their merit Is well known.
Because of there mild, soothing, and healing effect, Dr. Hamilton's Pills are safe, and are recommended for girls and women of all ages. 26 cents per box at all dealers. Refuse any substitute for Dr Hamilton's Pills of Mandrake and butternut.

By the way in which the hole is furnished, you may guess who the new occupant is. A mouse fills the cavity with grass; a flying squirrel, with its cast-off fur and other soft stuff. If the hole is crammed with twigs and bits of spider's web, a wren has lived there; if with fine straw, a few feathers, and so forth, probably a bluebird was the tenant ; if it consists mostly of feathers, wool, and cottony stuff, the occupant» are no doubt chickadees or nuthatches.

Egypt is still nominally a dependency of the Turkish empire, but for all practical purposes, both upper Egypt and lower Egypt arc British. The Soudan provinces of Britain now join the British territories in East Africa, which includes a frontage of about 400 miles on the Indian Ocean.
In the very heart of tropical Africa lie e the Congo Free State, with near- | I y a million miles area, nominally a Belgian dependency, touching British South Africa and also British Soudan holdings. It requires no bold ; stretch of imagination to conceive that when the powers sit down around Europe’s council board at the end of this war, Britain may ask, in payment for her services in sending un army to rescue Belgium, that the Kovereignty of the Congo Free State be intrusted to her.
France might be expected to as rent, because her African holdings would likely be consolidated and considerably extended as the result of her participation ip the war. With the Congo state in her possession Grfat Britain would possess a great strip, running almost due north and kouth from the Cape to the Mediterranean littoral of Egypt. She would control the interior lake region of the continent whose vast bodies of navigable fresh water are fairly comparable to the Great Lakes chain of Canada; the Congo valley, the gold and diamond reefs of South Africa, uad practically every mile of the Immense and rich valley of the Nile.

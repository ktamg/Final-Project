PO"*'
11. G. Well* Writes An Article
Which W as Suppressed by the British Censor.
In an article in the New York Times, written by H. U. Wells, but refused publication in Britain by the censor, the author seeks to give his personal views of the position of Holland in the present situation, for he holds that the I)utch hold the key to the problem. For the position of Holland is strung, as the risk of Germany attacking her vanishes daily, and she stands well with the allies. Were she now sub ject to any German outrage she could strike with her excellent army of 400,000 at Aix la Chapelle, and turn repulse into rapid disaster. Thus they hold a sword at the back oi the Kaiser, and they could cut the main communications of the German army in Flanders and capture enough Germans to open up the road to the Rhine, or, in fact, oould finish Germany.

Thousands of Dutchmen must he looking on the map at the present time and think ng su oh things as this. There, clearly and attractively, is the price of alliance.
The price of neutrality is an intact Holland—and a certain isolation in the years ahead But sti'l.

As far as I can judge, the English have done the utmost men can do, and, as the Englishmen have not mudh talent for organization, it is very commendable what they achieved. The commander was charming, mueh too good ^hearted, and he tried in every way to better our lives.
Now, says Mr. Wells, against the chances of doing this is her assurance of her freedom, the a lies fight for her and the German scare is leaving.her people, who have feared it forty years. Then she has ‘he example of the devastation of Belgium before her.

the habit of humanity of shuddering at the slaughter of men in battle, and regarding with a certain measure of equanimity the equally needless slaughter that goes on in our homes. Tuberculosis alone will kill ten times as many persons this year in Great Britain as will die abroad for their country, and were it not for the forces that are lighting it, the number would be greater still. Those forces are the army of sanitation, whose general staff and leaders represent all lands and all languages, and acknowledge allé-

That army will save more men from death by enteric fever this year than the other armies will destroy with bullet, shrapnel, bayonet and sword. Heretofore, in war, the army of sanitation has seldom fought winning campaigns, but the new knowledge that forms its plan of campaign and its tactics is eo full of promise that even the vanquished may be victors.

At the railway station, too, before he left to take command of the British squadron, a local Inhabitant approached and wished him good-bye. "I suppose it would be too much to ask where you are going, sir?" he said.

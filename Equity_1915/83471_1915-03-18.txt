Fixe acres of Ontario soil near a gold market can be made to easily support a family in comfort. In potatoes alone the returns would run, under ordinary prices, at from $ 100 to $200 per acre. From $400 to $500 per acre can be made from cauliflower. Many people will be inclined to regard these figures «> exaggerated, but they are facts, and many cases can be pointed out to substantiate our statements. , With proper soil treatment, the average garden will produce at least a half more than it now does. Several things must be borne in imnd. however, to make a success with garden crops, such as onions, potatoes, cabbage, etc must be suitable, cultivation must be thorough, varieties the best for the district and the market, and good salesmanship.
The plot selected for the garden should be well drained, and must not be shaded to any extent. Drainage takes away surface water rapidly, and keeps the soil water away from the surface, therein alb wing the roots to grow deep and the air to enter the soil and ail in decomposing it.

It seemed that Walpole was equally surprised, and when he next met Lord _ ' Chesterfield the eager question was, 1 l* Who Is Jones, and why should he be recommended for the position of poet laureate? Lord Chesterfield answered, "A better poet would not take the post, and a worse ought not to have It.” It appears that Jones was on Irish bricklayer and had made It Ills custom to work a certain number of hours according to an undeviating rule. He would lay a layer of brick and then compose a line of poetry, and so on until his day's task was over. This accounts for the marvelous evenness of bis verse.
This was but a small discovery, but It gave a real pleasure, for should I meet my Lord Chesterfield he and I would at once have a common interest We both had discovered Jones, and quite Independently.—Atlantic Monthly.

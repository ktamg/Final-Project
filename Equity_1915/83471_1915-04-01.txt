Warsaw, the chief city of Russian Roland, which the Germans have made no less than three brave but unsuccessful attempts to capture, was originally nut a Polish eijy at all. When we first hear uf it in the ninth century, it was the residence of the Dukes of Mazovia, and Ma to via did not belong to Poland irti-til 1526, although the inhabitants of both regions were probably of the same stock. Not long after 1526, however, Lithuania, which is the region that lies to the eastward of Prussia, was also united to Poland ; and Warsaw, because it was more centrally situated than Cracow, the capital of old Poland, or Vi)no, the chief city of Lithuania, became the capital of the enlarged kingdom. Such it remained through the century when Poland was at the height of its power, and through the years of slow humiliation that led to it* downfall.
When Poland was divided among the nations, Russia gut possession of Warsaw ; but singularly enough, in 1796, the city was handed over to Prussia, Which is now fighting so hard to get hold of it again. Napoleon delivered Warsaw from the hands of the Germans, and made it the capital city of an independent

Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People are an all year round tonic, blood-builder and nerve-restorer. Hut they are especially valuable in the spring when the system is loaded with impurities as a result of bhe indoor life of the winter months. There is no other season when the blood is so much in need of purifying and enriching every doae of these Pi Ms hel make new, rich, red blood spring one feels weak and tired— Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills develop the appetite, tone the stomach and aid weak digestion. It is in the spring that poisons in the blood find an outlet in disfiguring pimples, eruptions and boils—Ur. Williams Pink Pills speedily clear the ekiu because they go to the root of the trouble in the blood. In the spring anaemia, rheumatism, indigestion, neuralgia, erysipelas and many other troubles are most persistent because of poor, weak blood, and it is at this time when all nature takes on new life that the blood most seriously needs attention. Some people dose themselves with purgatives at this sea son, but these only further weaken themselves. A purgative merely gallops through the system, emptying the bowels, but it does not cure anything On the other hand Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills actually make new blood, which reaches every nerve and organ in the body, bringing new strength, new health and vigor to weak, easily tired men, women and children. Try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills this spring—they will not disappoint you.
You can get these health-renewing Pills through any medicine dealer or by mail cents a box or aix boxes for $2.50 from The Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Brockville, Ont.

ily When Hope Had Gone.
St. John, N R., Dec. 15th.—At one time U was feared that Mrs. J. Grant, of 3 White St. would succumb to the deadly ravage* of advanced kidney trouble. "My first attacks of backache and kidney trouble began years ago. For six years that dull gnawing pain has been present. When I exerted myself It was terribly intensified. If I caught cold the pain was unendurable. I used most everything, but nothing gave that certain grateful relief that came from l)r. Hamilton’s Pills of Mandrake arid Butternut. In- 1 stead of being bowed down with pain.1 to-day I am strong, enjoy splendid appetite, sleep soundly. Lost properties have been instilled into my blood —cheeks are rosy with color, and I thank that day that 1 heard of so grand a medicine as Dr Hamilton’s Pills.”
Every woman should use these pills regularly because good health pays, ' and It’s good, vigorous health that comes to all who use Dr Hamilton’s Mandrake and Butternut Pills.

A Western Canadian reservation Indian was disconsolate over the breaking of his axe-handle. He laid hie misfortune before theZ^B* of the reservation, who, through pity, took a new handle from his private stock and adjusted it to the axe. The “farmer” then noticed that the axe was shockingly dull; so, motioning the owner to turn the grindstone, he expended a half hours time in sharpening the blade. When the rehabilitated axe was given to the Indian, he was childishly gleeful, but still lingered about, indicating by his action that some feature of the transaction had not been adjusted. The “farmer” was a little annoyed, and called to an interpreter.
Ask the old fellow what he wants now,” he directed.
After an exchange of grunts and gestures, the interpreter announced, “He wants twenty-five cents.”
“Twenty-five cents! W hat for?”
“For turning the grindstone.”

Dr. Tingle'» Wit

Dr. Tingle, Professor of Chemistry at McMaster University, Is noted, among other things, for a very quick wit of a decidedly caustic vein. Not long ago while lecturing to a class of freshmen he referred to the formation of hall, and mentioned particularly the varying size of the stones. “The number of times they pass through these different strata of the atmosphere," he said, "determines the size of the stone, which may be that of a pea, a thumb-nail, a band, or even as large as a man’s bead."

Like most Irishmen, “Paddy” Nn-¦B	He was cas:
touched by a tale of distress and generous to a fault. About the beginning of the century, when Calgary was a good deal smaller than it is now, a railway man who lived in the town was killed in a wreck aird left his widow penniless. His •state consisted of nothing but a gold watch. It was little It would jring. but some friends of the wi-low, among whom was “Paddy," sought to Increase this pittance by lispoeing of the watch through a raffle. “Paddy" and some others un lertook to sell the tickets. The af fair had not gone very far, however, when an officious policeman swooped I lown and arrested the widow on a .'barge of conducting a lottery. She was haled off to court, but “Paddy" was beforehand. Approaching the magistrate who, he knew, was to try the case, and who had, at this time,
I heard nothing of it, he told a touching story of the woman's poverty, ind departed after having exchanged two of the tickets to the raffle for a rrisp flve-dollar note.
The case came into court, and Paddy," who was acting for the defence, had the woman make a clean breast of everything. Then he proceeded to lecture the bench. He told again the story of the woman’s loss and the straits to which she had been reduced. He pleaded her ignorance of the law, and when reminded that that was no excuse, he proceed )d to dilate on the danger of lotteries and raffles to a community. He painted a vivid picture of evils they might bring, and described at great length the punishments be jeemed meet for anyone who, knowing the law, should dare to conduct i lottery or raffle or act as agent for

Puny as was the battle, compared 9ven to a modest skirmish of thd present war, June 2 was a serious anough day for Canada In the year 1866 when Canadian troops first tasted battle with the invading Fenians.

One might have gone miles along the British front this week without hearing the sound of a gun. It seemed as if both sides were taking a holiday from war out of respect for the beautiful summer weather, or else the silence was significant of preparation and accumulation of shells by one side or the other for some great effort, writes Mr. Frederick Palmer from the British headquarters in France.
Beyond the occasional explosion of a mine and routine shelling to harass the enemy’s guns, to destroy new fortification work, or to keep the enemy from taking life too easily, there has been no action. The soldiers in reserve have been swimming in the canal, resting under shaded trees, playing cricket and football and tending their flower gardens about their quarters, which have been made to look like those one sees in front of rows of cottages at this season in England.
Summer Transforms Flanders.
The toll of casualties where there are only sniping and infrequent shelling has been much reduced owing not only to the increased adaptability of the men in self-protection—the result of experience in trench warfare—but to an immense improvement in the protective character of the work.
Though a trench may be on exactly the same line as it was im December, spade work in the spring and summer has completely transformed It, affording small chance for either shrapnel shell bullets or bullets fired by snip- | era from trees or buildings to hit the j defenders.

Had it not been for the highly-efficient system of fireranging, the timber burned through the attempt to clean off a few agricultural acres last year would have more than equalled the cost of the entire 80 farms.

No Immigrant* This Year.
“There is absolutely no immigration this year," said Mr. Hugh A. MacDonald, director of colonisation in the Ontario Department of Agriculture, a few days ago as it may seem, we have been better able to supply the demands for farm labor this year than ever before. This is owing to the unemployment. I suppose. The men supplied are of a good class. Ninety per cent, of them, 1 should may Irish, and Scotch about 1,500 this year so far of the farmers' sons have gone to the war, but they get their help for the farms from the local centres."

MEDICINE HAT.
| The Indian Chief From Whom the Canadian City Wae Named.
Not many persons know what was the origin of the strange name home by tbe Canadian city that Mr. Pud-yard Kipling once called “tbe city born lucky." •
The word ‘‘medicine’* means more to on Indian than to us. We think of It as meaning something nasty that i* good for ns, but the Indian distinguishes as "good medicine” and ' bad medicine" anything that be fancies will change bis fortunes for better or for torse. Imagine that Lo is hunting antelope and meeting with no success. Presently be finds an empty cartridge shell or the top of a tomato tin, and shortly afterward he gets a shot at bis game. Can he doubt that the piece of tin or the shell gave^the luck? Not he. He wears that fragment of tomato flu or empty shell about his neck with bis other Jewelry, and It Is "good-medicine."

Against all the increased effectiveness of war in killing, one single expedient has made defensive warfare more effective than ever before—the trench. It had its origin in the American Civil War. It was generally used in the Japanese Russian War With the advent of heavier and more accurate artillery it has become deeper, better protected, and better screened. Back ed by the fire of modern guns the odds in favor of defenders in trenches are greater than ever be fore.

Although most of us have never appreciated the fact, being just plain, ordinary folks more taken up with earning our bread and butter and an occasional oyster stew than in fussing over unimportant matters which are really none of our business, there is a great and interesting difference between an ambassador and a minister. The former possesses many privileges abroad that do not at all pertain to a mere minister.
A curious ambassadorial privilege is that, when dismissed from an audience with the sovereign to which he Is accredited, the ambassador may turn his back to the court. In this relation It should be added that the ambassador is the representative of his ruler; while the minister is the representative of his country.
When the audience Is concluded the ambassador abroad waits to be dismissed by the sovereign dismissed the ambassador bows, retires three paces, bows again, retires three paces, bows a third time, turns his heels, and walks to the fold-
doors ¦¦¦ sovereign is a woman a more polite method is employed. Not to turn hie back would be to resign a privilege. Fhe ambassador therefore retires sidewise
sovereign, and with the other manages to find the door. By this unique means he contrives to show all politeness to a sovereign and at the time to retain his ambassadorial privilege in retiring.
Another privilege of an ambassador abroad Is that of being ushered into the royal presence through folding doors, both of which must be flung wide for him. No envoy save ambassador can claim this privilege, the greatest favor in this respect that can be shown any non-lmbassadorial representative consisting In the opening to him of one door only.
There is one privilege of the ambassador, a privilege that sometimes occasions great Inconvenience to the ruler, which consists of his right to demand admission to the sovereign by day or by night.

The general result was that high-pitched sounds produced a more disagreeable impression than those of low pitch, and since it appears that the grave sounds are more agreeable to the ear he recommends that such sounds be used for signals as much as possible.

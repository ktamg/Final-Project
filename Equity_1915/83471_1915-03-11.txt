Advice to Stage Villain.
“Don't go down to the scene of your crime In the last act.” says Jerome K. Jerome. “You always will do this. We suppose It Is some extra cheap excursion down there that attracts you. But you take our advice nrnl don't you go. That Is always where you get nabbed. Tbe police know your habits from experience. They do not trouble to look for you. They go down in the last act to the old hall or the ruined mill, where you did the deed and wait for you. In nine cases out of ten you would get off scot free but for this idiotic custom of yours.” — London Standard.

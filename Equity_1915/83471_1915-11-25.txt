THREE NEW BRITISH LIEUTENANT GENERALS
A TERROR TO SLACKERS.
About the Household
The New Commander-In-Chief in the
Dardanelles.






All the official dry-aa-dust details of tho lifu of Sir C. C. Monro, the new commander-in-chlef in the Dardanelles, have been published. Hera | some more intimate details from | an officers’ mess somewhere in France. In appearance he is a rather thick-set man with a short, bristly moustache nnd steely eyes, full of character. Ilis voice is quiet but cm! phntic. Every word he utters and every gesture ho makes Is instinct with a restrained pugnacity and dog. gednese. On parade he is typically British, and no general can inspire more confidence with less personal effort. You can see a regiment stiffen under his very glance. A terror, but a Just terror.
He is a terror to slackers—officer.

Life in camp was very miserable.
Those who were able to work were sent out in batches to pull ploughs, barrows, etc. Food was very bad and, according to Law, would not have been given even to pigs in Scotland.
Black coffee was served without sugar or milk and so strong that the men could not drink it. The “food" called bread appeared to be composed of potatoes, oilcake, and bran. It was soft and damp, and would, said Law, have made a splendid substitute for putty. It was indigestible and made most of the men ill. Latterly Law subsisted almost entirely on food sent from home. Even worse than the bread was the “potato soup.” The prisoners were given plenty of a watery mixture containing an abundance of potato skins, but it is Law’s belief that the sentries got the potatoes.
Another dish was herring soup—with

London Laundries Raise Price.
The latest industrial combination to force up its prices is the Launderers’ Association, which adds 10 per cent, to laundry bills because the British public is alleged to wear 12,000,000 fewer collars since the war than before the war. This saving in collars is based, says the secretary, on the assumption that the 3,000,000 men in the army and navy used to send an average of four collars a week to be washed.

Suits for Men and Boys, Overcoats, Ulster®, Pea Jackets, Coon Coats, Fur Lined Coats, etc., at such low prices that will o|>en your eyes in astonishment.
We claim we save you money. Here is where we prove it. By buying heavy in Blue Serges last spring, we were last week rewarded with a shipment of our old lines of Blue Serge Suits, and more so. we are going to sell them at the old prices, to give our customers the benefit of our good buying.
Our $ 17.00 Blue Serge Suit is a peach, and we point with pride to it. It is a Pure Wool Botany Serge, fast indigo dye, and made up to a standard, and if you can duplicate this suit anywhere in Shawvillf * at less than $22.<W, we will cheerfully take it back and refund you your money.
Brome Gratta in Alberta.
The grass that is giving the bent results in the southern portion of Alberta le Brome, and as a plant to crowd out weeds, it is probably one of the best, as It forms a very heavy sod, thickening up by means of underground running roots. It should be sown about ten to twelve pounds per acre some time between the 15th of May and the 15tb of June. If the land has been summer fallowed the year previous a nurse crop of grain may also be planted, but If It has not, better results will be obtained by seeding alone. Where this Is practiced it will be necessary to mow the ground two or three times during the summer to keep the weeds in check.

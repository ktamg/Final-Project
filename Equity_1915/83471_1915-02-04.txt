To encourage this reasonable Hudgins sjk.kc briefly in appreciation Kraut# might be made by the Militia of the Homemaker- Club as an intlu- I Department towards the establishment of local rifle ranges, which both young and old would be only too glad to utilize. Indeed, In this regard the time has come when serious consideration must be given to the matter of the establishment of ranges In every township throughout the country, so that an opportunity be given to civilians to learn to shoot.
Some day we hope to be able to gratify his Ideals of an Indian regiment who may be able to compare favorably with the splendid achievements of those from India, who are giving such a tine account of themselves in France and Belgium.
The Indians throughout Canada have every reason to be appreciative, too, for the liberal disposition of ,
Major-General L»*ssard and the De- I partaient of Militia in extending every opportunity to Indians to enlist | in the contingents that are being pre- 1 pared for the front. I am glad to see 1 they are responding well to the call; and I further hope every young man ' who is capable and physically tit will come out and do his duty.	j
I know the spirit of war is rife on the reserves. While many of us will not be eligible, on account of old age, to enlist, we should go in and drill and form home guards, so as to be prepared for any emergency. I would also advise all Indians to be very reticent and uncommunicative to strangers, and keep a sharp eye on all suspects, and be ever ready to give information to the civil authorities A recent visit to my native home on the Grand River found me soon in touch with the martial spirit of war, beating in the hearts and minds of even the unlearned. Those who could not read were making their dally treks to the homes of those who receive daily papers, eager to learn the latest news, which is always cheerfully given and fully explained.
Equally Interested are the women, who were ready to discuss possibilities of doing something useful to assist in patriotic work of women.
They were getting ready to ask the chiefs for a vote of money to purchase yarn to knit socks for the soldiers.
Some interesting episodes can he related as to the determination of men to go and enlist at the nearest regimental headquarters. Some have gone the length of letting their crops go ungarnered rather than forego the opportunity of proving their patiotism.

K good part has been placed at the Déposai of the War Office and the Admiralty, as public distress Is not abnormal, and there is, therefore, no pressing need for its widespread dls-rtbution to the poor. In those cases srkere the flour Is being used for re-lef purposes by the local commuées, the loaves baked from it are «sued with a paper band, on which s Inscribed the words: "This loaf Is nade from flour sent by the people if Canada."

Professor J. H. Morgan h«A j translated into the English Ian-) guage The German War Book, a i manual of usages in war on land issued by the General Staff of the German aroiy. This is the most 1 autlioriVative work of its kind in| Germany. There is a reference in the introduction to “humanitarian considerations which not inf re-/ <1 uvntly degenerate into sentimentality and flabby emotion.
The revealing passage is the following: “A war conducted with, energy cannot be directed merely against the combatants of the en emy, their State and the positions they occupy, but it will and must in like manner seek to destroy the total intellectual and material resources of the latter.”

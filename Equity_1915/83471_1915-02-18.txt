Although lead is the softest metal in general use it is very dense. Thai is, its particles are very compactly united, and there is no room for air to circulate in between these particles. Most apparently solid substances are penetrated by more or less air, and this, of course, affects the weight "in proportion to the bulk. A piece of wood is lighter than a piece of lead of exactly equal bulk because the little particle* whic^ make up the piece of wood are not very close together, and il contains a lot of air.

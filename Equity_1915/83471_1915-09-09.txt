I Before the war the King of Italy's only claim to popularity consisted in his domestic virtues. Everybody admitted that he was a modest husband and father, a very good man and essentially a constitutional sovereign. But his subjects thought his inclinations were peaceful and that he preferred numismatics to soldiering. When the war came the King immediately assumed supreme command of the land and sea forces, and rushed to the front. Now everybody Is convinced that the King is as much a soldier as his father and grandfather.
The war has entirely changed the mistaken opinion about the King. Soldiers write to their families describing what the King is doing, what he says to them, and how he exposes his life just as they do. The letters have firmly established the King's popularity. The King at the front spends his time among the soldiers and often shares his meals with them.

Things Worth Knowing.
Don't black a stove while it is hot. It takes more blacklead, and a much longer time to polish.
When boiling potatoes do not add salt till they are nearly cooked. This makes them dry and floury.

the snoring shepherd took they, neither deviated they to the right or left. It was water they had come for; water they must have, or perish. ,
How long they were at the kegs no man knows, not long certainly; but when they left them, to explore the place, not a single drop of water remained.
A lark had just started to sing outside when, without warning, the sleeping shepherd started up.
There was blood on the man's throat, and blood on his hands, and on his face, too, were crimson spots, and even as he yelled, the whole floor of the place about him seemed to get up

Safe the corn to the farmyard taken, Grain ships safe upon all the seas— Homes in peace and a faith unshaken, Sailor, what do we owe for these ?
With this quotation the Archbishop of York, Dr. Cosmo Gordon Lang, begins an eloquent description of his recent visit of ten days to the Grand Fleet in the London Times.

The second highest flood at Edmonton came in 1899, when the river suddenly Jumped—almost in a single night—nearly 40 feet above low water mark. That flood was said to have been caused by a cloudburst In the Rockies, accompanied by very hot weather In the glacier-land where the Saskatchewan rises companied by no heavy rains In the Saskatchewan valley. In fact for some years following, when heavy rains for months at a stretch made the trails impassable and all the creeks Into livers, the big river rose less than half the height it reached In the glacial flood of 1899. .
Travelers down the Saskatchewan two years later saw the -marks of that flood; thickets of shore willows beaten down flat, debris lodged In the crotches of poplar and spruce and heaped up on the Juts of the Islands. One of the most Interesting relics of that outburst wss part of the old Saskatchewan steamer. The North-West, which was carried down from Edmonton and smashed up on the Journey, the wreckage strewn at various places along the bank as far as 200 miles below Edmonton.

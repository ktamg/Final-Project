and selecting a small bush for my final cover, began to stalk him from behind. Moving slowly and cautiously, 1 reached the bush, which was fifty yards from the sleeping animal, quite easily. Then I moved out a few }ards to get a clear shot, sat down, aimed where the neck joined the shoulder, and fired. I pulled down, and only hit him in the leg.
Off he went- away from me, I am glad to say—at astonishing speed. 1 fired again ; but my shot only made him run the faster, and he disappeared over a gentle undulation. I followed him up, and was able to give him another bullet. He lay in some rather long grass, and was «o quiet that I concluded he was dying.
I caane nearer, down the wind, and after looking through the glasses, made up my mind that he was stone dead. Then I saw an ear twitch ?Nevertheless, I believed that he was as good as done for; but it was well to be cautious, and I crawled on my stomach to within thirty yards of him. I could distinctly see his wicked little eyes. He was lying with his nose down, knees bent under him, and every vulnerable part protected by his horn. There we lay, each waiting for the other to make the finrt move. He could not smell or see

In the Boer War, the British gunners who worked the fifteen pound field guns were frequently shot down by Boer marksmen. Since the guns of those days reco’led, carriage and all, about four feet every time that they were fired, the gunner* had to jump outside the wheels ai each discharge. Gun shields were useless. Then the French inventée the quick-firing gun, now used it one form or another by all the arm ies in the present war. It has a shield of steel to protect the gut crew, but it# great superiority liee in the fact that the gun only recoil», wnd so the gunners can remain safely behind the shield. According tc a writer in the Illustrated London News, the gun itself, when fired, slides along guides on top of a stee box that ia called the cradle. In-* side the cradle is a piston attachée to the gun that the gun in recoil in a drives into a cylinder filled with
glycerin, through narrow
ervoir full of compressed air, which it further compresses. The friction "f the glycerin

There In Homo Similarity Between Condition* of the Two
Conflict».
The New York Evening Post has an interesting niui informing com parison of present conditions in Europe, and particularly in Britain with those obtaining during the Napoleonic wars, which follows in part :
To find a parai I l to the condition of Europe to day, it is necessary to go ha to the Napoleonic wars, ami u is interesting to notice the startling similarity which links the two great conflicts, separated by the gulf of a century. Those were hard times in Britain, and starvation was an ever present menace. Then, as now, the country had staked its all on the result of a titanic conflict. Then, as now, the country entered war fresh from the turmoil of a deep social unrest. Then, as now, Ireland was conspicuously to the fore. But in the midst of it all, the life of the country went on in much the usual routine—exactly as it is doing now -and men and women declined to permit themselves to be perturbed by the threatening spectre of the Corsican's armies encainjH»d just across the Channel at Boulogne—Boulogne, which is now one of the hases of that British army battling side by side with the French against a common enemy.
Year Was a Hard One.
The opening of the year 1800 was gloomy, indeed. So utter was the want that it had been communicated to the highest quarters. The civil list was more than a year in arrears, and the King’s servants were obliged to present him a petition begging that some portion of their wages be paid them. It was several vears before the King caught up with him expenditures. In that year, too, the Irish Act of Vnion was passed, in consequence at tlie ever present menace of revolt revived by the 98 uprising and the meddling of the French. Public sentiment was exceedingly uneasy concerning the war. People did not at first display the same calm confidence which strikes observers in England to-day, although later they became used to it, the national life returned to its accustomed channels.

Our method Is a little more elaborate than that of Germany, whose soldiers carry a metal disc bearing a number, which corresponds with a number at the Berlin War Office. After a battle numbers, not names, are telegraphed and verified. And the effectiveness of this system may be Judged by the fact that after the lighting round Met* In 1870, when the casualties exceeded 40,000, complete lists were posted In the capital • | two days later.
The Japanese system Is very similar. Each man has three discs—one round his neck, another on his walst-

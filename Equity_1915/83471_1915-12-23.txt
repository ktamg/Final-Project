source of great strength not only to the Bank, but to the whole of Canada, in these trying and difficult times.
The profits for the year, however, were most gratifying. Amounting to $2,108,631, they provided for the usual quarterly dividend and two 1% bonuses on the Capital of $16,900,000 ; the War Tax on Bank Note Circulation, $127*347; and left over $60,000 to be added to the Profit and Loss Account, bringing the balance of the latter up to $1,293,952. This, of course, is in addition to the Rest Account of $16,000,000—equal to the Capital.
Owing to the reduced volume of commercial business in the country, the current loans dropped from $108,* "<45,332 in 1914 to $99,078,506. Loans to municipalities, on the other hand, show an increase of over two millions, reaching the figure of $11,203,472.

ances, and persisted in acting Indo-pendently. Mr. Jiaultain contended that the Governor had absolutely no right to spend a cent without the sanction of the board.
Matters reached a crisis at the JOHN BRIGHT,
opening of the session of 1889, and, I ,,	. ,	4
as a protest, Mr. Haultain and hia 1 n*'l,,ent* colleagues resigned. The Lieutenant- OTTAWA ()\T Governor promptly sent for Dr. Brett i	*
and invited him to take office. Ho consented, selected hia three colleagues, and announced to the Assembly that lie was now leader of the Government. He further stated that he was in full accord with the Lieutenant-Governor's attitude on the question in dispute.
Then the Opposition asserted itself. A motion was promptly introduced to the effect that the position assumed by the new board, as set out in the statement of their leader contrary to the wishes of the Assembly. It was carried by a good majority. Dr. Brett, seeing that the sentiment of the House was against him, sent in his resignation.

Though the resignation of the board was formally accepted the following day, the Lieutenant-Governor did not proceed to name a new board

wrong. Instead he prorogued the House and virtually continued Dr.

In contrast to the statements of I full particular-.! g some travelers that the Eskimo I should be left alone in their ignorance and squalor stands the forceful testimony of Mr. John Firth, a Scotch officer of the Hudson Bay Company, who has been in the north for over forty years. Bishop Stringer quotes his remarks on the changes wrought by Christianity in the Eskimo.
•The Huskies (Eskimo) are as different as light is from darkness compared to a few years ago. They used to be dishonest and treacherous. Each man carried two knives, one in his boot leg and the other in his band, and no Âne felt safe when they were about. They stole whatever they could lay their hand's on When the Husky boats were seen coming up the river for their annual visit in the

But nearly all the official and contemporary jn counts of the disinternment in 1840 of Napoleon’s remains for the purpose of their translation to Paris, affirm that this, too, like Darling’s original outer coffin, was made of mahogany.

We may as well finish here this story of the death-mask; for it is at this point that Darling's narrative throws some new, but not perhaps quite conclusive light on what has long been a moot question.

The predominant influence on the history of the world has been not the soldier, but the sailor. A Frenchman once said that it was the ships of Nelson which won the battle of Waterloo. England has never possessed a great army, nor has the United States. When the German Emperor read the books of the American seaman, Admiral Mahan, he determined that he must have a great fleet, because from the days of Xerxes and Themistocles navies have decided the fate of empires. It might be said that all the decisive battles of the world have been fought on the seas. That would seem a bold statement, but it is a clear approximation of the truth. Without sea power, land power—that is, soldiers—must he imprisoned, and in ¦ modern economics conditions may well be reduced to starvation—starvation for want of shells as well as food.

SPEED OF ANIMALS.
Comparative Times of the Average
Animals.
Since April the German positions
The “speed of a gazelle, a horse/’ “fleet as a deer, an ox,” are all familiar terms. But few know just how fast or fleet oi slow these things are. An interesting computation just made by scientists is designed to throw light on the matter.
A riding-horse covers 40in. whilf walking, while at a jog-trot it covers lift, in a second. The two-minute horse covers 4 4ft. in a second.
The leisurely ox moves over only 2ft. a second when hitched to a wagon, and about 20in. when attached to a plough.
The elephant which can pull more than six horses, moves over about 4%ft. in a second, and running as rapidly as it can, is able to travel but 18ft. in a second.
The lion is claimed to run faster than the swiftest hunting-horse, which is from 80ft. to 100ft. a second, according to the country through which it is compelled to travel..
Tests differ greatly as to the speed of a hare. Some claim it can travel at the rate of 00ft. a second, while others claim it cannot travel more than half that distance.
The great variety of deer are all quite speedy, but in certain localities they can travel much more rapidily than in others. A roebuck has been known to cover 74ft. a second when pursued by dogs.
The giraffe is said to pass over the ground at the rate of about 50ft a

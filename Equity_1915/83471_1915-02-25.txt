Students Enlist
J
Seven students of the Wesleyan Theological College, of Montreal, have enlisted in the Field Ambulance Unit, attached to the Second Contingent. The young men, who have responded to the call to arms are : J, W. Graves,
H. E. White. R. H. Parkes, W. H.
Norman, W. A Hawley, C. W Topping, and F. E. Armstrong.
The last named is the fourth son of Mr. and Mrs. James Armstrong, of Green Lake, who were in Montreal on Sunday, (14th) to bid their boy farewell, before his departure, which is likely to be soon, am the recruits were told they must be prepared to be ready to leave for the front on 48 hours’ notice.
As a token of the admiration of the splendid spirit which ha* made these students abandon their college course to serve the Empire the Rev. James Smythe, Principal of the College, gave a reception on Monday evening, which is reported

[The following poem from the pen of a Canadian aoJdler with the first contingent ie reprinted from The London Dally Mirror.]
I hear the clear note of the bugle And the roar of the calling drum.
And 1 feel the swing of the marching men,
And a deep, deep voice eaye, Come.
For the arrow of duty pointa forward,
Tho the heartstrings quiver and break,
Yet the voice of my calling country la one I may not forsake.
For my manhood heeds and listens
And bends an attentive ear,	• \
And tho war's alarm may bring me ¦
harm,	*
My road Ilea plain and clear.
It stretches wide from my own fireside,
At the far end stands the foe;
And tho grim death meets my eager
breath,	•|
I am ready and glad to go.	-
For England asks for the sons she

To the East, West, South and

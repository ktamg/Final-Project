The Redpath “Sugar Loafe” of 1854 was the first cane sugar refined in Canada. “Redpath Granulated" of 1880 was the first Canadian granulated sugar.
Redpath Cartons" of 1912 marked the introduction to Canadian Stores of this new and better way of marketing sugar.

For Sixty Years Redpath Sugar has consistently led in purity, in quality, and in the appreciation of the thousands who use it It is the product of a thoroughly modem refinery, operated by men of skill and experience, whose one aim is sugar perfection.

Vite Mrs. Borden'.*» Lamil> (»<*** Hark * to Middle of I7tb ('ciilury.
A very sweet and kindly old lady a*a» the late Mrs. Andrew Borden, of * rand Pre, Nova Scotia, whose death it an advanced ago has just been recorded. From her. Sir Robert Bor-len, her eminent son, inherited many )f those tiner qualities of heart and aead which distinguish him. Always ¦Sentie and unassuming, she vatched her son’s rise to fame with the pride md devotion of a good mother, and he on his part, be it said to his crelit, always rendered her that respect And attention which were her due.
The Premier’s second Christian lame, it will be remembered, is Laird. That was his mother's raaid-30 name. She was Miss Eunice Laird and in her younger days she was one of the beauties of Grand Pre. This historic village, in which the legend of Evangeline is Jealously preserved, was the home of both the Bordens and the Lairds. Well might Miss Laird have played the part of the famous heroine, if all reports are to be believed. She had the charm of manner and of look that are associated with the Acadian beauty.
Andrew Borden, the Premier’s father, was a solid type of citizen, and for many years was associated with his wife’s brother in a general business in the quaint old village. Later in life, he became station agent on the newly-constructed Windsor & Annapolis Railway, now the Dominion Atlantic, besides which he engaged to a certain extent in farming. There was nothing outstanding about him, except perhaps that he was a well-read and intelligent man, who believed in giving his children the best possible education advantages. The late Mrs. Borden was bis second wife.

concealing plainness, for the pretty yellow tints at the bases of their winiv and tail quills are almost entirely hidden. Their double wing bars are also inconspicuous, so the yellow showing through the middle of the I closed wing, slightly brighter on the male. Is the best distinguishing mark. A pair quite devoted and evidently determined to make their home in one of the surviving pines of a suburban ravine seemed to find a supply of food among the litter soiling the few lingering patches of snow. They were tame as sparrows, which suggested a winter residence far from human intrusion. On the ground their quiet tints made them almost invisible, but they ceemed to prefer the snow still heavy in tbe shaded hollows, thus attesting their fondness for winter and their happy ability to survive its protracted cruelties.

Only in the past dozen years or has it become imperative in all civilized countries, in recognition vf the immense numbers of persons who are color blind without knowing it. to demand that all app'i cants for railroad, art, steamship and engineering positions shall submit to color tests. One man almost in every twenty is color Wind.
The new discoveries about color blindness arc many and increase al m«ist every day. It has just been found that women are never color blind. Yet color blindness is a characteristic that is inherited and passes on from generation to generation.
This >eoms odd at first thought. Nevertheless color blindness is inherited. according to the ’aws of Mende lia n hereditary. If all are born girls, it remains dormant and reappears in one of every four male children of the next generation. In
n ns, queoce ..f this, it is « ;i < d a yex linked characteristic.
One in\ « stigator, 1 >i Howell professor of physiology at Johns Hopkins University reported that color blindness is more
common among imperfectly edueat-ed )»eisons titan among college and university graduates. This is not true It has nothing to do with education, although there is a form of defective vision which prevents the eye from seeing colors perfectly. This is due to tobacco and is not true of color blindness.
Another statement made in Prof. Howell s great volume on physiology is that one-hundredth of 1 per cent.—one woman in ten thousand —of women are color blind men are never color blind. That is an error. Even the most masculine of the sex have not- yet l>een show n to be color blind.
There are tw<» types of complete color blindness, each of which has to do with groiifvs of color—red to blue and white and black. W hen the color blind man has two important colors such as red and

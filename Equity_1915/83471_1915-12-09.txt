WINDSOR'S WOMAN CITY CLERK

tain
Windsor, Ontario, has the distinction of having the only woman city clerk in Canada. Some go even further than that and say she is the only one in the world, with the sole exception of a town in Poland.
This unique example of feminine endeavor is Martha A. Dickinson. She is young in years compared tc the incumbents of similar positions elsewhere in Canada, for example, in Montreal, where a member of the Canadian Senate holds the city clerkship.

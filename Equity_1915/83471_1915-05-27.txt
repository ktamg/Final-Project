CHAPTER XII.
For very i early a week those scenes continued, increasing in horror, if that were possible, instead of decreasing.
Vainly Ailsa strove in Home way to discover a means of stowing Muriels entrance to that room ; but bolts and bans seemed to be no more formidable a detriment to her than they once were to Mephistophelew himnelf.
When Ailsa thought herself most ;_;## against the woman she feared and hated, that moment the ttend stood before her, smiling in that cold, placid way which Ailsa had come to loathe and fear.
And then, after that time, slowly but surely, she began to feel the hideous influence of the woman stealing over her.
Once or twice she had submitted herself to the same ordeal that she had undergone that night in Ethel's room; but she found that she was playing with a scorching fire, wl.en one day she looked into Muriel’s eyes, as she was bidden to • approach her. and found herself mechanically obeying, not because she wished to deceive th-.» woman she was striving to outwit, .but because that awful presence compelled ter. .... .

Holding her throhh ng temples with both hands, she staggered over to/ the bed. Ethel was lying there upon her hack, her lips swollen and distorted, her beautiful blue eyes dulled and haggard, her hair disheveled, looking as little like anything human as one in that shape could possibly appear.
Ailsa shivered.

The Very Best
Elimination of Breeding PI area
In Urged.
Elimination of breeding place# for flies instead of waiting for them to grow large enough to be killed with swatters, is urged.
‘The. dirty, dangerous, disease spreading fly already has made its appearance in small number# and as the warm weather advances will he with us in countless millions. The fight of extermination should be started now.
“The most effective way to fight the dangerous house fly is to destroy the places wherein it breeds. Whim you swat the breeding place you are swatting flies by the wholesale. If only a few persons in a neighborhood are careless about this important matter, the community still will be pestered with flies. It is a great deal easier to remove the conditions that cause the flies than it is to try to destroy them with swatters and poison after they are with us.’’
Here is a fly-killing mixture which is recommended :	I
“To a pint of milk and water of equal parts add two tablespoon fuis of formaldehyde. Place in shallow plates with a square of bread in the centre of each plate. The bread furnishes places for the flies to alight, and as it absorbs the mixture the flies will feed from it more readily than from the edges of the plates. It is a good plan to place | plates containing the poison just outside the kitchen door, where the flies usually swarm to get in. The flies seem to like it and it kills them quickly

But for those who have not learned of these dangers, we quote from a recent issue of the Child Betterment Magazine, which comments upon thirty-five cases of children being poisoned last year:
The danger to children Is great, and the dangerto adults Is by no means inconsiderable."

The greatest depths reached by divers without apparatus are used by the pearl fishers of Torres, mostly Malayans from the smaller Islands. They go down with the aid of a stone and a loop In the rope thereto attached which they clutch with their toes, these organs being far more prehensile than In races normally shod. They seldom venture to descend below fifty feet a depth at which they can remain for two minutes. The stone enables them to remain at the bottom while they are sweeping the pearl oysters Into a basket attached to the stone. When the diver feels that be must come up to breathe he releases his toes from the beck et In the rope and at once floats to the surface.

At Sebastopol, during the siege, a Capt. Samoiloff, wishing some wine, ordered an officer to send a man for it. The man, a young soldier, took the money and started on the errand. Just then, however, a French battery had concentrated its Are upon the very spot where the young man must go outside the works. He stopped and turned back.
"I wouldn’t go out there for the world," he said.
An officer of course reported the act of disobedience to the captain. The captain in a rage ordered the man into his presence and demanded why he had not obeyed his order.

The Army-worm
The Army-worm probably above all other kinds of insects which increase in enormous numbers periodically, causes wide-spead anxiety among farmers when it appears suddenly in a locality, and in a very short time completely destroys fields of oats and other grains.
The Entomological Branch of the Department of Agriculture has just issued Bulletin X The ArmV-worm, prejiared by Mr. Arthur Gibson, Chief Assistant Entomologist, who has charge of investigations on insects affecting field crops. In this publication of 84 pages a full description is given of the remarkable outbreak of this notorious caterpillar which occurred in eastern Canada in 1914. The recent outbreak was the most severe of any which occurred in Canada, and the damage caused is estimated at *990,000, five-sixths of which took place in the province of Ontario. The value of the trenching method of control was amply demonstrated. No matter how big the advancing army of worms were, it was shown that crops could be saved from their ravage*». In the bulletin the insect is described in all its stages, and method* of controlling it are given. A full discussion is included on the life history and habits of the worm, its food plants, natural enemies, etc. The bulletin has 19 useful illustrations, several of which show clearly the digging of progier trenches and the results obtained in controlling thcwoim*.

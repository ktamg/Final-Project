C'heeae and Pepper Salad.—Remove the top from a sweet green pepper and wash out the inside, taking out all seeds and drying with a clean cloth. Cream a oaki of cream cheese with a little fresh cream and mix with it some chopped walnut meat# and a very little finely minced red pepper. Season with salt and pepper. Stuff the pepper with this and put on the ice until it becomes firm and cold. Then slice in thin slices with a very sharp steel knife and serve as a garnish for cold meat or else on lettuce leaves for a salad.

It is the opinion medical authorities, after long observation, that nervous d leases are more common and more serious in the spring than at any other time of the year. Vital change» in the system, after long winter months, may causa much more trouble than the familiar spring weakness and weariness from which most people suffer hh the result of indoor life in poorly ventilated and often overheated buildings. Official records prove that in April and May neuralgia, St. Vitus dunce, epilepsy and other forms of nerxe trouble are at their worst, and that then, more than any other time, a bloodmaking, nerve restoring tonic is deeded.

The latest estimate is that the National Transcontinental Railway, when lit in completed, without taking account of certain interest items, will have cost $179,580,000, and that the Queliec bridge, which is to connect tht sections, will cost $27,000,000 more The whole will Ik; quite $206,000,000 and when the law suits are settled lie $210,000,000
predict that $30,000,000 and $1,000,000 as subsidy for the bridge would be all the outlay the scheme would involve. Amateurs directing a big business terprise have rarely made such miscalculations.

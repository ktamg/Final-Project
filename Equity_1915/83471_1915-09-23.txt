There is still a very prevalent belief }hat rheumatism is due to cold Weather. This belief is probably due lo the fact that when the blood is thin fnd watery there is an acute sensitiveness to atmospheric conditions and a change to wet weather often means a return of the excruciating pains. Rheumatism, however, is rooted in the blood, and it can only be driven from the system by building up and enriching the blood. Hot baths and outward applications of liniment may give temporary relief, but cannot cure. If the disease is not attacked through the blood, it simply fastens itself more firmly on the system, and the sufferer ultimately becomes hopelessly crippled. The truth of this is proved by the case of Mrs. Frank Ford, of Calgary, Alta. Mrs. Ford says: “I was an almost helpless cripple from rheumatism seemed to have settled in every joint. My arms and hands had to be bandaged. My ankles were so swollen that I had to use crutches. After doctoring for a long time and growing steadily worsts the doctor advised me to go to Banff Springs. I stayed there for eight weeks taking daily baths and returned home poorer in pocket by about $160 and not one bit improved in health. I then entered a local hospital, but did not derive any benefit I was in such constant pain that I almost wished to die, and I felt sure I would be a lifelong cripple. It was at this stage that a friend who had been greatly benefitted by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills urged me to try them. I began the use of the Pills and after taking them a few weeks the swelling in the joints began to go down and the pain was relieved. This greatly encouraged me and I continued the treatment until in the course „ -v£V.sàee months the cure was complete. I had thrown away the crutches, could walk anywhere and do my own housework, and I never felt better in my life than I do at present i time, and all this is due to the use of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. I have also given the Pills to my daughter who suffered from anaemia and she has gained in flesh and become a strong, healthy girl.”
If you are suffering from rheumatism or any weakness of the blood give Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills a fair trial and they will speedily restore you to health and strength medicine dealers or by mail at 50 cents a box or six boxes for $2.50 by The Dr. Williams’

The following description of trench life at tfie Dardanelles was written by a soldier, aged 21, to his mother in Scotland:—
The chatter of the trenches is won-werfully cheerful; a mail from home, football, racing, reminiscences of festive occasions, and little happenings of the fight are all occasions for cheery banter. Then, of course, there is the grousing—not bitter, but all as a part of the day’s work. For the eye, all around the blue-grey muddy trench bank, sun-dried and parched, occasional glimpses of dusty plane trees, old Achi Baba’s wicked top. And the men, some on lookout duty at periscopes and rifles rendy for every offering target; others cleaning their rifles, mending their clothes, reading books, cooking, smoking, or eating. A queer, narrow life, but full of quiet interests. The sun blazes overhead, the guns boom, the shells scream and burst, the rifles vrackle and the bullets whistle, and the silly drama of war goes on while good men die. Stretcher parties make their way along the narrow path with their sorry burdens, voices are hushed, for a pal is badly hit. Oh the pity of it all.

In European countries where military conscription is in force inventors for years have been working on bullet-proof garments. While in America a certain type of inventor devotes his time to producing a perpetual motion device, in Europe the same type works on an impenetrable waistcoat and becomes the butt of all the jokesmiths.

Rubber Sheets for Ships.
The loss of the Lusitania, draws attention once again to the possibility of rubber as a sheathing or lining for the hulls of ships to avert or minimize a catastrophe such as that which then occurred. A good deal of research is understood to have taken place more or less on these lines, and the granting of patents for apparently hopeful devices has been mentioned from time to time. Experiments have shown conclusively that rubber is almost invulnerable to explosive attacks, and the application of the prir#iple to shipping does not seem to present insurmountable difficulty.

Josephine Kali 1 in aimn, the daughter of
Arnold Kahlmann, a millionaire of St
Paul, Minn.
Miss Kathleen Beresford, known among her own circle as “Lady Kitty,” came over from London to act as Miss Kahlmann'a bridesmaid at St.
Paul, and she afterwards spent considerable time with Dr. and Mrs.
Blacque in Berlin and Vienna. Her own marriage took place very quietly, it is stated, as the war was looming near, and shortly afterward the bride and bridegroom left England through fear of encountering the misfortunes of the “aliens.” Miss Kathleen had, of course, become a subject of the Sultan upon her marriage, and her husband, an officer in the army of his country, was liable to arrest and detention in a concentration camp.

The average fellow and his wife learn to 01 >erate a Ford with skill in an hour and a half.
That's the beauty of the Ford—aside from its inexpensiveness— any member of the family can operate it.
As an investment the Ford is as good as the grain. A year from now it will sell for slightly less than it cost, or it will give satisfactory service for five years to come. And 000.000 Ford owners w ill tell you that the operating cost of the Ford is ridiculously low.
A Ford means more time, greater earnings, more happiness, and no more monotonous sitting about the front porch of evenings. There will be rides to Bristol. Quyon, Portage. Bryson and Campbells Bayfishing and hunting trips to the north country, etc.
In the day time the head of the house will accomplish three times the work. In business the Ford takes you where business is—there is ho waiting for business to come to you.

within one-half of one per cent, of that of Great Britain. What more could a belligerent ask? The talk of floating the loan at four and a half per cent. Is childish. Anybody who knows the costs of underwriting could tell these critics that Canada would be worse off with a failure at four and a half per cent, than with success at frve per cent.

"Dear Sir,—The credit of the Canadian Government is deservedly so good and it has beeq able to borrow money so cheaply in the past that I am surprised that the recent loan negotiated should be criticized by the rate of interest. Such criticisms are unwise and unjust, and indicate an improper knowledge of the financial situation both at home and abroad.

The writer heard of one irritable regimental quartermaster who was constantly worrying the clothing factory for uniforms for his regiment.

These unfavorable conditions are likely to be accentuated after the war for Miss Knox expects to see a great Immigration of women later on. English women who have been called upon to fill the places of men sent to the front will not easily reconcile the themselves to return to their old drudgery. Their thoughts will turn naturally to newer countries, and Canada is likely to receive thousands of them. Because of the hardship of pioneer life upon women kind these immigrants will not In large numbers go West, but will remain in the East to compete with Canadian girls in every calling that Is open to them. It is plain, then, that if opportunities for marriage and for employment are to be decreased as a result of the war It will be necessary for women to open up some new fields for themselves.

Although oxygen and hydrogen had combined In this vapor, the heat was still too great for It to condense Into lio cents the liquid state. With further cooling;
however, it did undergo a partial condensation Into that form of water which we know as steam. At that time the globe was probably a great white hot ball, enveloped at a vast height above Its surface with a hissing shell or envelope of steam. In this Immense steamy shell was contained. In the vaporous form, all the water that the future earth was to possess. The oceans were there, afloat as scalding clouds!

The condition of the moon, is revealed by telescopes and by photography, shows that a globe may, as far at least as Its surface Is concerned, become absolutely arid, no water whatever remaining upon It, although In ages past It may have been covered with oceans.

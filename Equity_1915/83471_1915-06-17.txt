It has actually -been the case that white feathers have been given to men returned from the front on short furlough because they wore private clothes. One man thus presented was a naval officer whose ship had been sunk by a torpedo, and who had lost his uniform. Public opinion in England is strongly against the white feather method applied to men the army does not want.
Many Belgian refugees in Eng land are following King Albert's advice by working instead of relying on the hospitality of English folk; King Albert has told his people that he does not want them to live in idleness, as that would be bad for them. The unmarried Belgians mostly prefer to live in lodgings rather than in the established Belgian guest houses. So organizations have been formed to keep them in the straight and narrow path.
Unofficial daylight saving has come into being, for which many express indebtedness to the Zeppelin.

During the year the Bank s deposit business expanded very considerably. Its deposit* bearing interest increased over four millions, to $60,037,101.80, and its total public liabilities grew three millions to $71,769.613.81. The capital paid up and the reserve fund stand at $7.000,000 each.
Profits were necessarily affected by the efforts to maintain so high a ratio of liquid reserve or assets that could be ounverted into cash immediately. Current commercial b ans in Canada, the main source of a Canadian bank's profits, were reduced by $6,200,000, and the net profits for the year were $995,131, againet $1,218,694 for 1914.

Since the outbreak of the war, Prince Schoenburg - Hartenatein, Austro-Hungarian Ambassador accredited to the Pope, paid a daily visit to the Vatican. Besides his frequent audiences with the Pope he invariably conferred either with Cardinal Garparri, the Secretary of State, or one of the other high officials.
The matter of flavoring i$f an important City Dairy uses no imitations or synthetic flavors—we flavor our “Maple Walnut” with pure maple sugar—we use Pure Fruits in our “Fruit Ice Creams” and flavor our “Vanilla” with the Pure Mexican Vanilla Bean.

The following solutions are recommended by Prof. J. H. Panton, Ontario Agricultural College, Guelph:
1.	Copper Sulphate Solution.—Copper Sulphate 1 pound; water, 20 gal-lone. To be used oi.ly before the buds burst, and never to be applied on the foliage. When applied to peach trees, use 26 gallons of water Instead of 20 gallons.
2.	Bordeaux Mixture.—Copper sulphate, 4 pounds; lime (fresh), 4 pounds; water, 40 gallons. Suspend the copper sulphate In five gallons of water. This may be done by putting It In a bag of coarse material and hanging it so as to be covered by the water. Slake the lime in about the same quantity of water, then mix the two and add the remainder of the forty gallons of water. Warm water will dissolve the copper sulphate more readily than cold water. If the lime is at all dirty, strain the lime solu-

A girl's complexion is something more than a matter to concern her vanity. It ie an indication of the wtate of her health. Pallor in a growing girl means a thinning of blood. Parents should I watchful of their daughters’ complexions and should see to it that these danger signs are corrected. When a girl in her teens becomes pale and sallow, if she shows an inclination to tire easily, ie listless and inattentive to her work or studies, she needs Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, a tonic which directly and specifically corrects the condition from which she is suffering. A chemical analysis of the blood of such a girl would show it to be defi cient in just the elements that Dr-llisnis' Pink Pills can supply, which restore brightness to the and color to the checks.

akin would never look nice again I grew despondent. Then my appetite failed. I grew very weak. Various remedies, pills, tonics and tablets I tried without permanent benefit. A visit to my sister put Into my hands a box of Dr. Hamilton’s Pills. She placed reliance upon them and now that they have made me a well woman I would not be without them whatever they might cost. I found Dr Hamilton’s Pills by their mild yet searching action very suitable to the delicate character of a woman’s nature. They nevfer once griped me, yet they estab lished regularity. My appetite grew keen—my blood red and pure—heavy rings under my eyes disappeared and to-day my skin is as clear and un wrinkled as when I was a girl. Dr.
Hamilton’s Pills did it all."
The above straightforward letter from Mrs. J. Y. Todd, wife of a well-known miller In Rogersvllle, Is proof sufficient that Dr. Hamilton’s Pills are a wonderful woman’s medicine. Use, no other pill but Dr. Hamilton’s, 26c. per box. All dealers or The Catarrh-ozone Co., Kingston, Ontario.

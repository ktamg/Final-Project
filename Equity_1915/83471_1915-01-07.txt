“Dogs of war is a phrase which ones meant a thing as real as the war horse. Dogs have played their part in battles and campaign», and in the old wars between England and Scotland dogs were used by both combatants for pursuing and killing fugutives after a defeat.
It is related that Wallace and Bruce eatii had close escape* from capture by English bloodhounds. Bruce it said to have thrown the English dog off the scent by the, now known expedient of wading up, a stream far enough to baffle his pursuers, and Wallace evaded the hounds by having trick more or less common in those strenuous time* of killing a follower and leaving the body in the dogs path for them to come upon.

This Week’s List

As Mr. tfî W. Howell, leader of the Ontario Opposition, pointed out hi a recent address, the rates allow’d by the Ontario Workmen's Compensation Act to widows of men kill-"d In our factories were more than double what Canada was willing to pay to widows of soldiers under the present pension law. The widow of a workman will receive, under the Act, $240 a year if she has no children; if one child, $300; if two or more children, $360 and up. There Is an additional allowance for children up to the number of eight. If a workman is incapacitated, slightly or seriously, so that he cannot follow his usual calling, the weekly payment is based on 55 per cent, of the man's wages. In place of the soldier's pittance when wholly incapacitated of about $3 a week, the workman under the same circumstances will draw on an average of from $6 to $12 weekly.
It Is essential to remember that when the war is finished and the great task of looking after the dependents commences, there will be no patriotic or other public funds from which to supplement the Government’s pension. The $1.60 and $3.00 per week handed out to the heroes will represent in most cases the total resources upon which those men can rely for the rest of their lives. Pension funds in all countries appear to be based on the assumption that the widow of a soldier should devote the balance of her life to day labor, and indeed the same assumption would seem to be directed ât k lieutenant’s or captain’s widow. A wealthy Canadian cltisen, when asked for his opinion on i pension increase, made the remark that wives of soldiers should not be "supported In idleness" for the rest of their lives. This will probably appeal to most Canadians as a bitter and most unjust comment amounts to a declaration that the

The great care which has been exercised this year by the larger banka of Canada In maintaining them selves In the strongest possible position, and in this way being able to guard against any developments that might arise In the country, is strikingly Illustrated by the showing made by the Royal Bank of Canada In Its annual statement for the fiscal year end h g Nov. 30th, 1914.
1 A close study of the general statement of assets and liabilities would seem to Indicate that the management has given Its every consideration towards keeping the bank strong both !1n cash and Immediate liquid assets, such a policy being rendered advisable by the very unusual conditions (brought about In Canada by the out break of the European war. In order to maintain such a position, even op portunltles for profits were apparently Ignored to some extent, but as a result the statement, as a whole. Is perhaps the strongest ever Issued by the Royal Bank and at the present time this should be as satisfactory to shareholders as it Is reassuring to the put* lie generally. Under the conditions It enables the bank to play a prominent T>art In helping the Dominion through an unprecedented situation.

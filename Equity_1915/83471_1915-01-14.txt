When the harbor improvement scheme was tiret made public, and maps, charts, and graphic explana Gone of it were being shown at pub lie meetings and at club luncheons,
It was labeled and stowed away, in most people’s minds, as being one of the family with tubes schemes, or the new Union Station; a dream, a fancy. Out of the lot, the harbor improvement is one of the dreams
that come true. And to-day, after	_ _
one year of planning work and one |JN0t6 tü6 AddreSS : year of actual work, there is, on Toronto's waterfront from the Humber to the Don, one million and a half of dollars already spent in materializing the foundations of the dream, and of the total cost of nineteen mil- I —	_ _	__

For them, at least, the dream Is gratefully materializing What this great labor plans to do is to create, out of Toronto's natural and somewhat crudely-formed harbor, a fully developed harbor of even, economic formations, to fill in and make solid land of those hays and

blessed Toronto. Shore lines will b> protected by breakwater. Marshts will be made solid land for factories and warehouses. Instead of a waterfront covered with nondescript docks built out from a casual, uneven shore, there will be a shore line tilled out to an even front, from which uniform docks will project. The whole, when finished, will be orderly and economic. No space will be wasted.
In a way, Toronto may be said to be
performing only her natural, moral many a sad-nearteoi immigrant nas i duty ln rebuilding her harbor.

When Hanging Pictures.
An annoyance to all good housekeepers Is the line of dirt on the wall that forms at the backs of all pictures at their !ower edges and require: frequent dustings to prevent the paper or paint from being permanently marred by an ugly discoloration. To obviate this, take email nails, called brads, that are about the thickness of an ordinary pin and about half an Inch long, and drive one In each lower corner of the frame where It touches the wall, leaving out perhaps a quarter of an Inch. This will prevent the picture from resting against the wall; no dust can possibly settle there; It permits of a free circulation of air, and the tiny heads of the nails will not mar the most richly-decorated wall.

Charles Palmer's Name Is One to Conjure With In the West.
SEE and TRY a
DE LAVAL
Shawvllle, County Pontiac, Quo.
When Charlie Palmer, a strapping young Englishman of family, wealth, and position, was graduated from Oxford University, no doubt he dreamed of achievement, but It Is safe to say that he had no Idea of winning renown, wealth, and success by toting giant powder up a steep mountain trail.
This Is how It happened, and you can tell for yourself whether Palmer is entitled to receive from the hardy miners and prospectors of the northwest the warmth of good fellowship that he does. Palmer was on the Pacific coast when the news of a new gold camp swept him, with others, northward toward Alaska.
They followed Portland channel, which is the boundary between Alaska and British Columbia, to Its head, and he and some others, Including experienced miners and mine superintendents, came Into possession of some claims which "looked good" to them.
The pay streak was high on the side of a precipitous mountain. When they got squared away at their Job of developing what they had staked there was work which naturally fell to the hands of each of his associates. But for Palmer, who knew nothing about the fine points of prospecting, sloping, sinking, there seemed to be nothing be could do unless be should turn cook. But that was because of his education.
The fact that he had a degree from Oxford blinded the eyes of all but Palmer to the obvloua fact that If they were going to open up the claims they would need to have giant powder and food to do It. He looked too much like the debonair idler to be assigned to the drudging task, the herculean task of lugging powder up to the others who knew better how to do the actual work of drifting.
Twice and sometimes three times every day. until the veine were opened up and a prospect proved to be a rich certainty, he made the trip from the Bear River Valley up a winding, steep, and rough trail through the timber, over boulders, brush, and foot-log bridging roaring torrents to the first shaft, 2,400 feet above the valley, carrying packs that weighed from 80 to 120 pounds.
Day after day, and week after week, gradually Increasing bis loads.
Palmer acted as a human dray, and development work at the summit went on without interruption. It was a close race for the four men of that "outfit" between their available cash and the grub It would buy, and the day when the vein, exposed In a gully, should be reached and cut. The mine proved to be one of the big ones of the British Columbia coast, and somewhere is one Charles Palmer, Esq., who has the money and the leisure to follow the tastes and the whims which were cultivated by bis Oxford education.
And to this day it Is likely that he would do the trick over again. If the need should arise in the prosecution of the enterprise to which he had lent his hand and heart. He was In the game to win, and by his grit and sinew he and his partners did win.

We do not believe that a farmer who knows anything about farm machinery could he induced to buy any separator other than a Dc Laval after he had seen the latest improved De Laval machine and had given it a trial
It is a fact that 99% of all separator buyers who do SEE and TRY a DE LAVAL machine before buying, purchase the DE LAVAL and will have no other. The 1% who do not bury the DE LAVAL are those who allow themselves be influenced !!¦*¦**¦¦¦¦¦¦ genuine separator merit
If you arc thinking about buying a cream separator we will consider it a favor if you will permit us to set up a Dc Laval

Most of the furs worn throughout the country are obtained in the first pise* by the hardy and intelligent Canadian trappers. Although, of emirse, the Indians were the pioneers of the trapping of fur-bearing animais, the lonely trail of the red man has slowly but surety given away through years of civilization to the invasion of the white man, and the Hudson Bay Company has handled millions of dollars as the results of the labors of the red man.
At Urn progent time much of the trapping is done by farmers' sons, who find it a very profitable game during the slack time of the winter months, and also by men who trap during the season and fill in the summer months by helping farmers or gatbedag herbs.

In other words, the $1.70 difference In fencing cost Is rent at 5 per cent, on $34 worth of land.
So far a» la possible, the main fields on the farm should be of the name size and the farm should be laid out so that the soil in a field Is uniform.

NO REMEDY 80 SPEEDY OR
EFFICIENT.
A reaf cramp cure?
Yes, a real one—In a twinkling the cramp is a dead one, and the last squirm Is over, once you get a stiff dose of Nervlllne on the inside.
This isn't mere talk-—It’s a solid, truthful fact. No other remedy—not a single one—will cure cramps so quickly and harmlessly as Nervlllne. It hits the spot In a Jiffy and saves a heap of misery.
"Last Saturday night my stomach felt like an Infernal machine," writes T. P. Granger from Hartford. "I was awakened from a sound sleep and found myself suffering the worst kind of torture. 1 was so doubled up 1 could hardly cross my room. I had used Nervlllne before for the same thing and took a real good dose. Once I felt the warm, soothing sensation of Nervlllne in iny stomach 1 knew I was all right. It finished the cramps— just one single dose."
Sickness at night is rendered a nightmare of the past If Nervlllne is handy. It may be earache, toothache or cramps. Nervlllne in every case will cure at once and save calling the ¦ doctor. Nervlllne is a family physician in itself. The large 60c. family size bottle, of course, is most economical. Small trial size costs a quarter. All dealers sell Nervlllne.

Every night in the year E. T. Hunger, formerly chief of police of Lincoln, Nebraska, sleeps in his ooffin. The home-made box stands on the front porch of the Hunger residence, at No. 2314 Randolph Street, and at night, after the neighbors have gone to bed, Old Man Hunger goes out and climbs into the box. If the weather is cold, or if a shower comes up, he pulls the top of the coffin over the opening, leaves a crack through which he can get a little fresh air, md calmly goes to sleep. Mr. Hunger is now 70 years old, and for many years he has been sleeping in his coffin.

cadi of the nearest town, who upheld the second man's contention Î This is the way he reached his decision :
The three men divided eight dates; there were two and two-thirds for each, or eight-thirds. The first Arab had three dates, so he contributed nine-thirds to the whole, but he ate eight-thirds himself, so he gave only one-third of a date to the stranger.

uoh to die in these days just thought I’d play a joke on the undertakers and make my own coffin while I was well enough to do it. So I got me some inch plank about a foot wide and several pieces of 2 x 4. I put tho latter at each corner to make the box stable, and then I nailed it together with eight-penny nails. Whole thing cost me less than $5. but it’s strong enough to hold a man about my size without any trouble. And won’t those undertakers bo mad when I die and they can’t get any of my money 1
Tho Hunger home sits back from the street, and there are trees all around it. In the summer these trees shade the porch, and the gruesome object cannot be seen plainly. But when winter strips the limbs and branches Mr. Hunger’s home-made coffin can be seen by all passers-by.
For more than twenty years Mr. Hunger was a constable in Lincoln, and is one of the best-known men in the city. But the fact that he sleeps in his coffin every night is a fact known to few others than his neighbors and close friends.

Lord Cromer used quick and dar ing methods in dealing with Egyptian risings. At one time Cairo was almost openly disaffected, and the British garrison was small. His lordship, however, caused it to be known that & regiment was on the way from India, but be was careful not to explain that it consisted of sick-leave, and time-expired men and bandsmen.
All the able-bodied soldiers in garrison were ordered to parade all over the town in small parties, and the natives did not take in the fact that fhey were a sort of stage army —the same men over and over The last straw was when

A medicine that will keep children well is a great boon to every mother. This is just what Baby’s Own Tablets do. An occasional dose keeps the little stomach and bowels right and prevents sick During the hot summer months stomach troubles speedily turn to fatal diarrhoea or cholera infantum and if Baby s Own Tablets are not at hand the dhild may die within a few hours. Wise mothers always keep the Tablets 'n the house and give their children an occasional dose to clear out the stomach and bowels and keep them well. Don’t wait till baby is ill— the delay may cost a precious life. Get the Tablets now and you may feel reasonably safe. Every mother who uses the Tablets praises them and that is the best evidence that there is no other medicine for children so good. The Tablets sold by medicine dealers or by mail at 26 cents a box from The Dr. Williams Co., Brock ville, Ont.

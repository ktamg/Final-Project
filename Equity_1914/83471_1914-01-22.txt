That same simplicity in punishments was noticeable in nil the code. Tliere was no haggling about the chair v. the gallows.
Th ft from other pirates was unlawful. All plundered g«kds mus* be turned into the general pot and redistributed in kid or cash. F.ach pirate was entitled to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. • And all public cervices wire to be owned by

Feminine laws was strict, as might be expected. Thus, no pirate could retain for his own any woman captive. He couldn't even kiss her without obtaining, first tho supercargo's, and next the lad) 's consent All women captives were turned over to the general fund, Windsor ( astle to jim a - .-tlivr g- Is captured Then, on Saturday half-holiday, the pirates were allowed to buy which ones took their fancy.
The usual plan was to parade all the women. As one pleased a pirate be indicated her to the supercargo, who then credited that pirate’s account w ith one woman and debited it to the prevailing price.
As soon as all the women were chosen each pirate led his bride, or brides, as the case might be, to the chaplain's office, whole they were duly and truly married according to both l hinese and pirate law There were no affinities in Mistress Ching's piratical kingdom.
So piratical life hummed merrily onward.

Writer! ha%e made quite a to-do recently about the feminist move-mont in the Kepublic of China.
Chinese women, in the last few >vart, it is inferred, have "emancipated ' themselves. They wear No.
6 shoes, tight skirts instead of pajamas, attend teas, have culture clubs, want the vote, and every now and then smash a window just like their «iaters in more civilized, if not polite, nations ; and all this quite recently.
But that is all wrong—that is the recently’* part. The militant feminist. movement in China began when Mrs. Pankhurst'a great grandmother was a baby. To he exact, the first Chinese campaign, to verify Mr Kipling’s much-quoted philosophy, became noticeable in ISOti, and one Mistress Ching, u pirates# of gentle mein and some repute, vas its most active chain pion.
In the beginning. Mistress Ching was an uncommonly good-looking daughter of a man in Hupeh Province, who operated something akin w the modern spindle game. She

ït was believed by some reputable engineers that the valley at Gfttun was a li$ht silt which would not support a dam of the necessary size ; but investigation by the borings method showed that the foundation would be suitable. In order to overcome any doubt on this score tho dam was made very large, with a broad, flat base, so that in a sense it is floating on the underlying mass.
It was thought by others that such a dim would not hold the great lake behind it, 166 square miles in area, containing 206,000,000.000 cubic feet of water; but the size of the structure—500 feet at

Few people realize that the success of the Panama Canal will always depend upon the ability of the great dam at Gatun to hold bark the water» of the artificial Gatun Lake, writes a correspondent of Tho New York Times.

MONUMENTS TO POTATOES

"So that's it. is it Î ' crooned
Several German Town* Have Thus Glorified (he Vegetable.
There are monuments to human beings, to animals, and, in one case known to the writer, to a lifeboat, but it has been reserved to tier-» many to rear monuments to the po-
At Offenberg, in Germany, a private donor has ejected a really beautiful monument in honor of the IX) la to. The upper part is a statue of Sir Francis Drake, who is alleged to have introduced the plant into Europe. This, and the pedestal also, is draped with garlands ot the potato plant, with full-grown tubers. On one side of the pedestal is Drake s name, on another side is an inscription in praise of (he potato, on another the name of the donor is given.
Nor is this the only German town having a monument to the glorification of the potato. The town of Murz has a similar statue to Drake and the potato, and in several of the small towns of the empire there are similar monuments.
The fwnnY thing about these statues to Drake in association with the introduction of the potato Is that Drake had no more to do with the matter than you have. Accords ing to popular belief the introducer of the potato was Sir Wilier Ra-
l#'itth^6n
plant from his people whom he had sent out to colonize America, and he had some sent to him in Ireland, where he is alleged to have can sea them to be planted. Such, at least, ia the generally accepted version of the introduction of the potato, although we know that Raleigh had as little to do with the matter M Drake, for Raleigh found the potato already growing in Ireland, where it had been introduced by the Spaniards before his time.
But whether Raleigh or the Spaniards are the introducers of the potato we now stand little chance ol knowing; of one thing, however, we do know, and that ia that Drake had nothing to do with it. Yet Germany has erected statues to Drake and the potato.

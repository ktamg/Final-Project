It was very shortly after the completion of this contract that Mr.
Charles Whitehead decided to embark in the lumber busine Brandon, as previously related, a circumstance which led to his purchase of sections 3, 10. 19, and diversion of his activities to wheatgrowing for a time.

Recalling those early years Mr.
W hitehead humorously relates how it cost him $4,050 to secure a rebate of $602.50 on his purchase contract from the C.P.R. In his own language it happened this way:
In order to encourage settlement the C.P.R. allowed a rebate of $L#& an acre on the purchase price for every acre broken., That was just fifty per cent, of the actual purchase price in contract No. 1.

But let dyspepsia or indigestion get hold of one, and all endeavor becomes a burden. A woman writes :
“A year ago. after recovering from an operation, my stomach and nerves began to give me much trouble.
“At times my appetite was voracious, hut when indulged, indigestion followed. Other times I had no appetite whatever. The food I took did not nourish me, and I grew weaker than ever.

REPLENISH YOUR BLOOD IN THE SPRING
L'retkaee Held to Bf Le** Harmful
than Ether.
Interesting experiments with a new anesthetic have been conducted at the Cambridge Imho rip to ry,
/ The substance, whieb Is called Urethane, is a combination of urea and alcohol. It is administered hypodermically, and drowsiness soon becomes a very deep unconsciousness, and insensibility to pain is complete. There m perfect security when it is used in any operation. The advantage claimed for the new anesthetic is that heart failure never occurs when it is properly used, while a majority of the deaths from chloroform are due to heart failure. When the breathing stops, as it frequently does, during the administration of an inhaled anesthetic, it can usually be started again by artificial respiration, provided always that the heart is still beat-The assurance, therefore, that in cases of an overdose of this anesthetic the breathing would be affected before the heart will be of immense comfort to surgeons and aneethetiits.
Another advantage ia that the choking sensation experienced with ether and chloroform is not present. Moreover, after urethane there is no sickness, and thus the danger of stitches giving way and ligatures slipping off during retching is
experimenters have not yet been able to reduce the period of insen sibility below six ho operations up to the present have been made on animals.

Absolutely the most economical. It spreads easier, thus saving time in painting. It covers more surface per gallon—thus taking less paint for the job. It lasts longer, because it contains more Linseed Oil.
This is why “O.P.W.” Paint actually costs less in the end.
Foot rules and yardsticks are so common nowadays that not one person In a thousand ever stops to think cf their origin. Yet the length of these common articles was settled upon only after centuries of correc-! lion and contention, and after tbous- | The psim ;• like the «mile and of years of unsuccessful effort to find an unchangeable unit in nature.
The foot has been used In many nations, both ancient and modern, that scientists believe it was meant to be the length of the human foot.
The Greek foot, for instance, was supposed to be the length of the foot of the hero Hercules. However,
Hercules was a very large man; so their unit was measured 12.14 of our inches. The Macedonians probably took their unit, according to our authority, Mr. Fred Telford, whom we quote, from the foot of some
giant leader, for It was 14.08 Inches I	R c/s Apple Trade.

8lcJ*Jr# „	'or the Dominion fruit Inspection
The Germans, a few centuries ago, department attempted to secure a better unit by taking the average of a number of feet. A surveyor of the sixteenth century prescribed this rule: “Stand | Ex-Member For Jerque* Cartier Has at the door of a church on a Sunday,
I and bid sixteen men to stop, tall : ones and small ones, as they happen to pass out when the service Is finished; then make them put their left foot one behind the other, and the length thus obtained shall be the right and lawful rood to measure and survey the land with, and the sixteenth part of It shall be the right and lawful foot."
The foot thus selected, though undoubtedly capable of considerable I variation, was less elastic than the Inch of our early ancestors
provided by law in 1324 during the ,	10A,	4	....	.

In the twelfth towards these importunâtes. On one century, Henry I. decreed that the occasion a man rang him up at one yard should be the distance from o'clock ln the morning asking for a the end of his nose to the end of his I position. Mr. Monk told him to come thumb; we are not certain, however, I round to the office the following in what position he held his arm and I morning. Sure enough the man was head when the measurements were one of the throng outside the Minis taken. He went so far as to have ter's room in the Public Works De a metal bar of the proper length partment, before nine o'clock. All made; and then copies were pre- (the morning he waited, and when Mr. pared, stamped, and declared to be royal measures.
The earliest yardstick now in existence was prepared near the end of the fifteenth century in the reign of Henry VII. This stick, made of bronze, measures 35.924 of our modern inches in length, and was used as the English standard until 16*8.
The new British standard of 1588, was called the Winchester yard, it was made of brass, and remained the legal standard until 1826. The bar Is In existence to-day, and offers ample evidence of the truth of the report made by a commissioner who examined It in 1742:	“A kitchen
poker, filled at both ends, would make as good a standard. It has been broken, and repaired so clumsily that the Joint is nearly as loose as that of a pair of tongs." Nevertheless the officials worried with It until 1826, for the simple reason that they could not agree upon a new standard.
The belief became common In the eighteenth century that such perishable things as the king's arm made unsuitable standards; but It was thought that a unit In nature might be found in the pendulum. Therefore a committee of Parliament, In 1760. caused John Bird to prepare a standard of measure based upon the seconds’ pendulum. This standard, which measured 36.00002 of our inches, was not sdopted for more than sixty years. Finally, in 1824. it provided that Bird's yard should become the legal standard on the first day of January, 1825.
The British had not yet learned, however, that accurate standards are hard to make, and that, once m they are worth careful attention.

Rare volumes of Tibetan medical lore and others in the Buriat language have been ruthlessly damaged. the leaves having been torn out and scattered about the floor. A complete set of lama processional she masks has been apparently hacked about with knives and utterly spoiled. In a word, irreparable damage has been done, and who the culprits are, no one on the spot seems to or care.

PAINT is not cheap simply because the price is low—if you would economize on paint, you must look beyond the purchase price per gallon.
The cheapest paint for you to use is the paint that takes the leaA amount for the job. It may coA a little more per gallon, but because it thoroughly covers more surface, wears better and stays bright longer, it is the moA economical in the long run.

Dick Rathmell hesitated, hoping for a line from May, but a long interval paaaed without any tidings whatever. Then came a picture-postcard from a provincial town, stating that she was now with “The Queen of Hearts' company.

The Play# Are Long and the '‘Invisible” Characters Are Unique.
Although the Japanese have copied the best Institutions In the world In remodeling their own, the theatre In Japan is essentially different from other countries, and some of the best Ideas might well be copied by our houses of imusement. The revolving stage, for Instance, which allows the scene to be changed without a long tiresome wait Is ene of them.
Other features can ot be so much commended. Take for example the dressers to the chief actors, who flit hurriedly to and f o dressed In black, which gives thorn the appearance of black spectres. They are supposed to be Invisible, and in addition to throwing around the actors with a marvelous dexterity the changes of costume they act as valets. It Is amusing to see one of these “shades” giving the hero a cup of tea, a fan, a handker-ch.ef, or, if the situation is a dramatic one. holding a taper at the end of a long stick, which lights up the actor's face.

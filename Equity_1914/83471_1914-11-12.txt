This central registry acts as a clearing house. Only eonvelescents, who would have been given sick furlough to their own home#, they so desired, are being sent to convalescent homes. Convalescents who require continued hospital treatment, will be sent either to the special home in connection with the hospital from which they are transferred (under the supervision of the medical officer of the hospital) or to one or other of the private hospitals already referred 1 to.

Arrangement ,*f Transferring Sick and Wounded to Various Hospital*.
It may be of interest to the public, the London Press Bureau mes sage suggests, to know how the sick and wounded of the Expeditionary Force are being received and distributed after their arrival in Great Britain.
All the hospital ships proceed to Southampton, where there is special staff for the reception and distribution of the sick and wound ed officers and men who are being sent un them. The arrangements are under the control of a surgeon general, who hold* the appointment of a Deputy Director of Medi cal Services. He has at his command twelve ambulance trains spe «dally constructed for the convey a nee of four officers and ninety-six men lung down, or for a consider ably greater number of patient# sitting up.
Twice weekly telegram» are re reived by him from all the larger Military and Territorial Force Gen eral Hospitals, stating the number of beds vacant in each With this information before him, he arranges convoys of sick and wounded on arrival and dispatches them to their destination in one or more f the ambulance trains.
Emuii Station in Motor*.
Already the sick and wounded from overseas have been comfortably placed under treatment in most of the large Military or Territorial Force hospital centres. At the railway station» of these localities arrangements are made by the military authorities for conveying sick and wounded in motor cars or ther ambulance vehicles from the railway station» to the hospitals. Voluntary Aid detachments have already done useful work in connects n with this stage of the movements of the sick and wounded ed. and it is expected that the scope for utilizing Voluntary Aid in this direction will be extended as it» y able becomes better know n.

in order to enable the convalescent to be placed on sick furlough in « convalescent home, all that he has to do is to inform the medical officer who is in charge of him where and what county or neighborhood he would like to proceed to. These particulars are entered on a form and sent to the Central Registry. The address of the nearest railway station to the convalescent home in the neighborhood is entered on the form, and it is immediately returned to the medical officer of the hospital.
Whenever the convalescent is ready to leave on sick furlough the medical officer sends word to the convalescent home, stating the hour of the man’s arrival at the railway

Military Hospital* Find.
As the military hospitals get filled up arrangements have been made for transferring sick and wounded from them to various hospitals arranged by voluntary fort. Many schemes have been submitted to the War Office, through British Red Cross Association, in accordance with Field Service Regulations. At present the opportunity of using private hospitals to any great extent has not arisen, as there are still several thousand beds vacant in the Military and Territorial Force Hospitals. There is no doubt, however, that in time pmatr hospitals will be of much un as an overfl >w, and also when it i* necessary to set free a sufficient number of beds for future requirements in the larger military biffilsh

When the full story of the pr«-j went, the bloodiest of all wars,1 comes to be written, its page* wtUf thrill with deeds of daring and self sacrifice for cause and country. Even in those times of stern censorship, tales are to liand of splendid heroism, which seem to be without parallel in the pages of the past.

For Scotch eggs boil six eggs hard, take them out of the water, crack them, and put in cold water; this will preserve their color and make the shell come off easily. Roll the eggs in flour ; take either a pound of sausage meat, cold fowl and ham, or any savoury mixture of cold meat ; season well with pep^ per, salt, parsley, and a pinch of nutmeg ; divide the meat into six portions, envelop an egg in each, dip into beaten egg, cover with bread crumba, and fry in boiling fat. which must be deep enough to cover the eggs completely each egg in halves before serving.
For Scotch broth put on your pot with let* than two gallons of water, a teacupful of best barley and peas, let it boil, add 1% lb. of good, fresh beef or mutton off the flank, one carrot cut into very small slices, one quarter of turnip the same. Cut another carrot into thick slices and a half turnip (to eat with your meat), let all boil together for an hour, then add another carrot grated, and quarter of turnip also grated three or four good thick leeks, two or three potatoes cut into pieces.

Ways of Saving.
Save badly cut pieces of bread, and wlives left over from the table for a bread pudding or a Brown Betty. Save every scrap and crust to crumb up for stuffings or to use for breading scallop dishes, croquets. etc.
t Remove the sinew from the legs of s fowl when it is drawn and the meat of the leg will be as good as that of the second joint.
3 (old rice should always be saved, it can be added to a soup, mashed into croquets, mixed with eggs, and fried like hominy or used Id % scallop dish.
,•4. Left over vegetables when the amount is too small to be served again may be mixed in a soup sliced together and boiled with gravy for a ragout, or used separ Sicily or together for a salad. Cauliflower, potatoes, and cabbage

CLEANING
Works Office, Sand Point, Ont
We have no doubt it does. One out of every ten watches that fail to give their owners satisfaction need cleaning and oiling. Sometimes the owner neglects it too long, and the result is worn pivots and general debility on the imrt ot the watch. A good watch is the cheapest in the long run, and if it is carefully cleaned and oiled once a year, it will last a lifetime ; yes, a hundred years. Such a watch is a source of satisfaction to its owner.
He can meet an engagement or catch a train, and never has to
excuse himself with “ my watch must be slow."
To the busy man an actuate watch is a necessity—-not a luxury, as some people seem to think. To utilize every moment of precious time, to be always on time, one must have a good watch. Drop in and let us talk watches to you, we are practical watch repairers and watchmakers, if you please, and you can have the benefit of our twenty years’ ex|>erience without charge.

Free Seed Grain Distribution
s
Right Now is The Time
By instructions of the Hon. Minister of Agriculture a distribution of superior sorts of grain and potatoes will lie made during the coining winter and spring to Canadian farmers. The sample for general distribution will consist of spring wheat (about 3 lbs.,) white (>ats (about 4 lbs.,) barley [about 5 lbs.,) and field pens (about fi lbs.) These will lie sent out from Ottawa. A distribution of potatoes (in 3 lb. samples) will be carried on from several of the experimental farms, the Central Farm at Ottawa supplying only the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. All samples will be sent tree, hv mail.	I
Applicants must give particulars in regard to the soil on their farms, and some account of their cx-perience with such kinds of grain potatoes) as they
a promising sort tor their conditions may be selected.
Each application must be separate and must be signed by the applicant. Only one sample of grain and one of )>otatoes can be sent to each farm. If both samples are asked for in the same letter only one will be sent. Applications on any kind of printed form cannot be accepted.	I
As the supply of seed is limited, farmers are advised to apply early ; but the applications will not necessarily lie tilled in the exact order in which they are ceived. Preference will always be given to the most thoughtful and explicit requests. Applications received after the end of January will probably be too late.
All applications for grain (and applications from the provinces of Ontario and Quebec for potatoes) should be addressed to the Dominion Cerealist, Central Experimental Farm. Ottawa. Such applications require no postage.
11 otherwise addressed delay and disappointment may occur.
Applications, for potatoes, from farmers in any other province should lie addressed (postage pre-|iaid) to the Superintendent of the

Not Too ( lean.
The visit to the domicile, or the iglo. M. Vanasse writes, is not what one may think. The iglo is of circular form, eight feet in diameter and as much in height. It is made of blocks of snow, the door is st the bottom, on a level with the ground, it is about one foot and a half wide by two feet high. It is not every one that can pass through it easily. To get in one must at ft rat get on his knees, then lie flat on his stomach and slide in, snake-like, for a distance of about ten or twelve feet in this tube of the same dimension as the door. One never gets in
and comes out of it spotless, for this vestibule is not kept in an exaggerated state of cleanliness. Once in the iglo you are asked to sit on a block.of enow, which is covered with a deerskin.

We are determined to close out our entire stock of Misses' and Children’s Summer Dresses.
One of the chief reasons why we sell so many Summer Dresses is because the people know they will always find with us New Dresses every Season. We realize that to sell you Summer Dresses at this season we must make the price so low as to make it a money saving opportunity.
We have re marked them at a price so low as to leave no doubt but it is a Come and see.
Along with the Summer Dresses we include our Boys’ Wash Suits.

William Rufus built the hall in 1097, but it was not until three hundred years later that the artificers of Richard II. undertook the stupendous task of replacing with a single span a roof that was originally built with a nave and side spans. These forgotten builders did their work well ; they understood and provided so well for all the possible lines of strain and thrust pressure and resistance that the great timbers seem to soar from corbel to corbel.
It was the irony of destiny that in 1399 the roof that Richard had constructed looked down on the ceremony of his solemn deposition. Two and a half centuries later there was another striking scene in the hall, for in 1657 Cromwell, robed in

Many boys and young men of these days who have heard more or less about the old time bootjacks have probably never seen one, because with the abandonment of the wearing of boots by men and boys the bootjack went out of fashion. In the old days, especially In the winters, the man or boy who wore anything but boots was rare and the bootjack was a necessary article in every house.
Boots were worn without rubbers, and frequently to keep out the enow and the slush they were treated to an application of mutton tallow or some other greasy substance, but these applications did not always keep the feet dry nor the leather soft The leg of the boot In the vicinity of the ankles Was sure to have deep, heavy wrinkles, and when the boots got wet and then dried on the owner's feet the wrinkles became hard, and It was no easy mat ter to get those boots off. It generally required considerable labor over the bootjack. It required tugging and tugging, and after the Job was finally accomplished the boots would generally be left near the stove for the night to get a thorough drying out for the morning.
Getting the hard boots on In the mornings was always more of a Job than getting them off the night before. If the wrinkles at the ankles .were hard at the time the boots were taken off they were even harder and etiffer in the morning, and that added to the task of getting them on. The owner would shove his foot down Into the leg of the boot, the forefingers would be shoved through the straps, and the haul at getting the boots on would be-

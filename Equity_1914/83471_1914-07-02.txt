AN ELEPHANT III NT.
A Hunier Tell» of H le Experience
In Burma.
"The finding of a big round footmark imprinted in the eoft asnd at the bottom of a nullah began one of the meet delightful hunting experience* of my whole life,' may# a recent correspondent of Field. It happened in Burma many years ago, an in a moment all other game was forgotten, and my little brown friend Moung Aingyi, and I gave ourselves up, body and soul, to the fascination of following the elephant trail.
"The sand at the bottom of the dry watercourse was soft, and tin-footprint# were deep and well defined; hut after a time the track left the nullah and led through the level valley land, where tall grass formed dense walls on either side, and arched above our head* as we followed the path that the elephant had made for us.
"The afternoon was drawing to a close, when suddenly the silence was broken by a series of rending crashes that grew fainter and fainter, until at length all was silent again. Something had startled the great beast, and he was gone. Long after dark we reached a
little village, and interviewed the white-liai red thuggi, who received ..¦with true Burmese hospitality. Yes, indeed, there were many elephants in the jungle, in particular a mighty tusker who had a mate and a little one running at her side. They drank often at a water hole not far from the village. Doubtless this was the huge elephant we had been following.
"Moung Aingyi and I stumbled out into the darkness together and took the road to the water We. We reached it at last, and on the top of a high, cliff like bank -we waited!
The water hole lay below tome fifty yards away, half hid

This happened not long ago to a small lad. He is only 6 years of age and the eon of a fireman. He plays all day long at firing his toy engine, and it may be that he was pretending.the pin was his match, and was holding it in his mouth while he tried another “match ' on his FimaJl trousers.
PI* In Tonsils.
Anyhow, the pin disappeared and another liid to be hunted up. Nobody cared. But, presently, the small fireman began to complain of hi* throat. The tonsils appeared swollen, and on in particular to be greatly enlarged. When no other symptoms of tonsilitis or other throat trouble developed,-the family physician advised the removal of the tonsil*, and the little lad was taken to the surgeon whose deftness in tlie uee of the new throat instruments had robbed this operation of half its pains.
After the removal of the little fireman’s tonsils one of them was found to contain a common or garden variety of pin, which had done its beat to be swallowed, but had not quite succeeded.
One day a small patient was examined with the gastroecope—an instrument inty^noed into the stomach to explore it for foreign objecta. A little jump illuminated the ten-year-old interior, and there, re peeing neatly and viciously, was a black pants button. To remove it was the work of a garment. It was caught in the dipp^-likc and «*f the gastroscope and deftly pulled out, leaving not eo much a# an irritating scratch on the sensitive lining of the patient's diaphragm.
There are other object* that contrive to get themselves swallowed. Nails in nearly all size* have found their way into folks’ interiors, and screw eyes and other hardware have slipped down unwilling throats.

Did you ever hear tell of “Wap-ping old Stairs " down midst the “Pool?” No? Here is found yet another scene altogether of kaleidoscopic London. I^rge bulky fig ures abound here that live in sou ! westers and oil skins. They get their precarious living on the broad and muddy bosom of old Father Thames. Here are to be found the homes of a great number of the lightermen, whose lives are spent board those lumbering scows and barges that pass up and down, like guant shadows in the night. Up as far as Kingston and dow n to Sheerness they ply their trade, huge unwieldy hulks, and yet many has been born aboard one of these floating homes. Yes, and died there, too ; and many a wee face rocked in the arms of a whitefaced woman, that looks out over the surging tide, bemoans the loss of a father and husband.

It is difficult to imagine the *uf^ fering* of the boat * crew of the Columbian, who drifted about the Atlantic for fourteen days before being picked up, for only the strongest could stand such exposure, says London A newer s.
An example was provided by the two boats of the Carnarvon Castle which -was burnt some *05 mile* from West Australia on January 31 »t, 1907. The captain said they would reach land in seven days, but it was twenty-four before, by good luck, they chanced on the only apo* where they could land.
A Thrill of Horror.
On February bth the boats kxdf sight of one another, but on the' twenty-fourth clay the mate's crew, arrived at Kottenest Island, and the captain’s at ( a;»e Naturaliste,I having had no water for four day# and no meat for the fame time,! some having been without for seven days. Although tl>ey had drunk salt water it did not see-m to do them any harm, and only one man and two apprentice* succumbed.
With clothes in rags, weak from! lack of nourishment and sleep, another day or two would have finished them. They bathed to cool their bodies and smoked leather for lack of anything else. It was said that it was largely <>wing to the captain’» courage and maintenance of the usual discipline and watches that land was reached.
Then there was the ghastly story of the Mignonette, which sent such a tlirill of horror through the country in the middle eighties. Sailing for Australia it foundered in a gale 1,600 mile* from the Cape, the Captain, mate, a sailor, and a boy getting away in a p rov i si on I e fis boat.
For days they drifted, getting weaker and weaker, and then it was proposed to draw lota to determine which of them should be killed. However, this was rejected, but on the twentieth day the boy was killed by the captain, the survivors feeing picked up four days later. The captain and mate were tried for murder on their return, sentence of death being commuted to six months' imprisonment.

There is no science of greater direct benefit to mankind than the science of surgery. The kindly knife has cured where nothing would have availed. In orthopedics alone —that branch of surgery which cures crippled children—surgery has eirned its place as one of the great beneficent sciences, and in a hundred other branches it has to its credit the most striking cures.
The successful surgeon must be daring, but as cautious as he is bold. A constructive imagination,

When a bean or kernel of corn is swallowed by accident, Nature promptly begins her own surgical methods. She makes the patient tough. Often success crowns her efforts. Sometimes the foreign object, even one as smooth and innocent as a grain of corn, refuses to be coughed up.
A surgeon recently introduced a bronchoscope into the right lung of a small boy and extracted therefrom a large kernel of corn, which the surgeon afterward* planted and from which two ears of corn were produced. The little lad s lung

The hours dragged by, and my eyelids were drooping when Moung Aingyi touched me lightly. Even a^ he did ®o there broke out, as it seemed, above, below, behind, and all around me a sound that surely could not be of earth. There below us stood his lordship, deep in the cool water, the moonlight burnishing the glory of his tusks as he bellowed for his tardy mate, whose shrill voice echoed far away.
"1 gazed upon this glorious sight, and fingered my big rifle half heartedly. Then I heard the am awering trumpet, nearer now and louder, and a little squeal of joy And there,splashing in the pool, where there had been only one, w<fe three, the smallest member of the family a most absurd miniature edition of his parents. They drank their fill of water, and the old ones took water in their trunks and squirted it over each other and the baby, and they all wallowed in the family bath. Then they waded out to a bank of soft, dry sand, almost immediately beneath our perch, and recommenced their play. Suddenly they ceased and stood silent, motion leas, suspicious. The tusker stood broadside to me, and 1 raised my rifle once more. Moung Amgy i was trembling audibly, and my own blood seemed to surge to my head until the throbbing deafened me.
“But I could not pull the trigger. I laid the rifle down as far from me a* I could, and as I did so the whole family turned, tliere was a faint shuflVs of feet, ami almost imperceptibly they faded away into the darkness. Then we stole through the dense jungle once more, while the moon and star* paled at the approach of day.
"Moung Aingyi seldom question ed any of my doings, but a.s neared the stockade he turned a piteous little brown,, wrinkled face toward roe, and, in a voice that teemed to have tears close behind it wailed out the question that was in his mind. ‘Why did the thekin

Perhaps one of the most ghastly tales of shipwrecked mariners adrift concerns some fifteen survivor* of the 150 men of the French frigate Medusa, who crowded on a badly-j made raft. It occurred just a century ago, the frigate striking a rock when sailing at full speed.
The captain climind into a boat, and 150 soldiers and sailors crowded on to a hastily-made raft 65 feet by 25 feet. It was to have been towed by the boats to the nearest land, but before going far the rope of the captain's boat broke, and the rest cut their cables. Yet land was known to be close, and the same evening was made by the boats.
On the raft were a few casks of _ .	wine and some biscuits, part of

Quite naturally you ask, “why?” Because O.P.W, Paint contains more Linseed Oil than other high-grade pure Paints. It is the Linseed Oil that determines the wearing and protective quality of paint. O.P.W. Paint protects longer—looks better—costs least in the end—because its colors are ground in oil and because the paint, when it comes to you, contains more Linseed Oil.

No one would grudge free import to those who breed pedigreed stock In the country nor object to Government keeping their stud and herd books for them, but probably most people would subscribe to the proposition that having these things they should by their produce show that they were breeding as good stock for the price as any one could Import direct and duty free. If they cannot show this, surely no one would support a protective system for tbelr benefit for the effect would be that those who desired pedigreed stock to cross with half-bred herds—and they are the main support of the whole agricultural Industry—would get worse animals for their purposes and pay a higher price.
Now, In the moat Important breeds, fchould an intending importer apply to know whether say the Percheron Stud Book or the Durham Herd Book !j recognized as reliable by the Government, he will be told by the committee that It Is not, and he will be Invited to register In the Canadian book for these breeds, a record inaugurated and d! reeled by a group of persons already engaged In breeding or Importing that class of stock, a bcok kept by the National Record Committee under their directions upon which body they are represented.
Bearing In mind that the Intending Importer's free entry la thus made to depend <a> on his being a British subject resident in Canada, (b) on his owning the animal and (e) on hla being able to get the National Record Committee to record It before he gets free entry, It obviously takes but little ' to delay, defeat or obstruct him In hla 1 endeavor to obtain It

The roan liad hold of one aide of the bridle, while Louis, with a pluck unknown before, kept a firm grip on the other. The horse being tugged at on both aides; had he not been the angel he was, there would have been trouble.
The man holding the bridle opposite to Louis seemed to me a most formidable person. Still, I tried to smile with calmness, and although I was shaking all over, said, ‘ Pardon, monsieur, will you permit me to have my horse harnessed ?" I think ho waa completely taken off his guard, for, with the, intuitive gallantry of a Frenchman, he answered me amiably. Throwing l»i<k hie coat, he showed me his badge and said, “I am the agent of the Committee of Public Safety, and it is for the government that I take

I made him observe that it won hi

“I understand, madame, and I give you back your horse.” And he even helped Louis to re-harness the horse, which seemed happy to return to his shafts.

the law may say, the practice leaves him in doubt and he must feel fairly sure that the National Record Committee's system leaves him at a disadvantage. Months may, and do, elapse while he Is piecing together documents required by the committee. Meantime he cannot sell the animal and does not know what it is to cost him ultimately. The keep makes a big bole in his margi;. of profit. The American purchaser of a like animal at the same sale has his purchase through the customs without delay. His importation Is not subject to registration In any books kept by his trade competitors. They cannot force him to record In books kept by them, and with good reason for except where an animal Is intended for use In a registered herd, recording in such books in bis own country Is of no use either to him or to bis country, but the registration being a voluntary matter, he can apply for It when and as It seems to be of any use to him.
Enough has been said to show that free Import as affecting pure breeds intended to be bred to half-bred herds Is not given due effect to.
As to the result of the system on the pure bred herds already In the country and through them on the class of animal to be bought out of them by the farmer for cross breeding, It may be pointed out that the only use to thr country of such herds is to supply the farmer with as good an animal In price and quality as he could !m port direct from abroad. Such a class of animal local breeders only need to produce under the direct stimuli* of competition. If that be removed, and It Is In part removed by the difficulties in Importing direct then they will sell him Something not quite so good as hie American competitor may get abroad at the same eoa

HOW TO BE COOL.

WÉ
Variety of Your Food Not So Important a* Quality.
Keeping well in the summer and avoiding extreme discomfort from the temperature is not so much a matter of the kind of food eaten or avoided, according to I)r. William C. Woodward as it is of the quantity of food consumed and its quality and freshness.
"Much is said about avoiding meat in summer,
ward, "but a» far as lean meat is concerned, provided it is /resh and in as good condition as in winter, there is not much to support this theory. The trouble with meat in the summer is that it is likely to spoil unless care is taken, and then, of course, it becomes unwholesome.
"Again, one should not get the idea that it is safe to ©at all of the vegetables, cereals and other foods that he can. Overeating is realty the source of much of the trouble with persons who feel oppressed by the heat, rather than the eating* or avoidance of particular foods.
"Of course the body does not require so much heat producing food in summer as in winter. The appetite takes care of that to a large extent. Moderation is really the important thing. The man who eats moderately and within the bounds of reason as to selection of foods, and who lives temperately otherwise, can follow his usual regimen with but little change." x Some of his pertinent hot-weather suggestions are :
"Don’t overeat. A furnace is not stoked in summer the way it is in winter.
"Avoid alcoholic drinks. Alcohol never yet made anyone cooler.
"Be sparing in the use of ice water. Water cooled in bottles placed next the ice is preferable I to water containing ice.
I "Wear loose clothes of a light •©lor.
I "Take just enough exercise to I keep physically fit.
"Keep in the open air and in the
shade.
"If possible, sleep in the open. "Take cool baths rather than cold ones.
"If you can avoid it don’t fret.’

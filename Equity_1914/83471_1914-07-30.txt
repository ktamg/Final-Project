HE more highly refined a sugar is the better the product
A pound of highly refined sugar is equal to considerably more than the same quantity of raw sugar, because in the former, water and foreign matter have been removed.
The quality of any sugar depends upon the degree of refinement to which
it is subjected*
The art of refinement has reached its highest standard in St. Lawrence Sugar.
St. Lawrence represents the finest quality sugar that scientific refining, combined with the choicest raw materials can produce.
While the price of lower grade sugars appears cheaper than St. Lawrence Sugar, they are in reality more expensive because a much larger quantity of inferior sugar is required for sweetening.
The idea that any sugar is exposed to dirt, dust or other impurities and is scooped by soiled hands out of a dirty bin is repulsive to the fastidious housekeeper.
To avoid this, buy St. Lawrence Sugar in sealed cartons or sealed bags, which, from the time it is manufactured in the Refinery and until the package or bag is opened by the consumer, never comes in contaCt with human hands, nor is exposed to the air.
It is to your interest to insist upon having St. Lawrence Sugar either in 2 or 5 lb. sealed carton packages or in 10, 20, 25, 50 or 100 lb. sealed bags, which may be had either in fine, medium or coarse grain.
For sale at all good grocers.

Some of World's Greatest Poems Written by Old klen.
Tennyson's Crossing the Bar was written in bis 81st year, Robert Browning's Aaolando was published the day of his death In his 77th year. Swinburne's greatest poem, Tristram of Lyonesee, was not published until that poet was well Into middle age. These, according to Richard Le Gaeltenne, are but a few examples which controvert the widely-accepted theory that poets do their j reach best work In the heyday of youth.
The fact that certain young poets have died premature dramatic deaths, has established a certain picturesque convention, amounting almost to a superstition, which limits the production of poetry to youth and early m n h
able, notion la on a par with the starvation theory of poetry, the garret and candle-end and bread-and-water regime for poets who, it is fable 1, have usually gone hungry and tireless and unprovided alike with overcoats or negotiable appreciation.
As a matter of fact, the starved poet is a rare exception, and a mere glance through any history of literature will suffice to show that, on the contrary, most poets and literary men generally have either bad private incomes, been made comfortable by kings or other admirers, or have been substantially supported by their read-This only by t,ay of a aide Ulus-

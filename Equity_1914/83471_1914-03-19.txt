According to Jack, the livery roan, however, the visiting team did not represent P. D. F. but was rather an aggregation of pu * chasers attached to the C. N. Co’s construction staff. This fact did not seem to cut auy ice so far as the result was concerned, a* the locals took care of the bunch in easy style, and won out with a score of 4 to 1, which the visitors secured In the first period. *

DESERTS FROM GULF STREAM.
ace
Second Gnlf Stream In Atmosphere —Chilled Passing Over Sweden.
The Gulf Stream, as every one knows, is a broad river of warm wa^ ter which starts in the Gulf of Mexico, wanders across the col<l Atlantic Ocean and bumps into the British Isles giving them a climate and no end of fog and ram. But few people know that in the at. mosnhere above there is a second Gulf Stream of warm, moist air.
This elow, damp breeze strikes the British Isles and does not car-rom off like the Gulf Stream, but continues over Europe. As it passes over Sweden, 1 inland and northern Russia, these cold lands chill the wind and cause it to drop its moisture in the form of rain. The lakes and rivers of these northern countries are all supplied by the moisture taken up from the Gulf Stream.
The rotation of the earth makes this wind veer gradually to the southward about tho time it ha? given up the last of its moisture and warmth. As a mighty draft of dry, cold air, the Gulf Stream wind moves on across the plains of Russia. As it approaches the Equator the wind warms again but becomes ever drier.
At last as it sweeps over Turkea tan, Arabia and Sahara, it evaporates like a great sheet of blotting all water it meets, forming

From ihe Dominion and the Provincial Governments, and from municipalities, up to the eime date, there have been received, by the <yjnipan-forming the Canadian Northern Railway System, whilst under the control of Mackenzie, Mann & ( om-pany, $20,992,666, in cash subventions, or about seven per cent, of the total cost of the railway mileage constructed.

Spencer, B.S.A., gives the fol lowing rules for testing with a th* r mometer. "The boiling point of liquids varies with their density and with the altitude above sea level. At sea level water boihi at 219, ey rup at 219, sofi sugar at 238 to 240, and hard sugar at 249 and 246 deg. Fafcr. The boiling point for each of these it lowered one degree for about 660 ft. ascent.

International Code.
From time immemorial flags bnve been flown by ships it sea all over the world, but it Is only In more recent years that an International code has been adopted. All the countries of the world now conform to fired rules about the flying of certain flags, though, of course, each navy has its own secret code for use In war time.
The national flog of any ship when hoisted upside down denotes that the ship In question Is In difficulties and requires immediate assistance, which any passing ship Is required to give If possible.
The quarantine flag Is a plain yellow square, hoisted on the foremast, which indicates that the ship has got an infectious disease on board or that It has come from an Infected port. No person Is allowed either to go on board or to leave such a ship until permission is granted by the sanitary authorities of the port
In all parts of the world a white flag Is accepted as a token of peace, a red flag as that of defiance and a black flag as that of a pirate. A green flag flying from the masthead of a ship or barge at anchor Indicates that there Is a wreck In the vicinity. The same Is denoted by a green buoy placed over the spot
When a red flag Is flying on the foremast It is a sign that the ship has powder, shell or ammunition on board and serves as a warning to other ahlps not to come too near In case of accidents. It Is called the danger or more commonly the powder flag.—London Qlobei

Wolfe quit Loulsbourg and sailed up the river to capture Quebec In the year that the last shingle nail wan driven In SL Paul's and the “Grand Parade" was alive with a grand gusto of Governors and Colonels and Dukes and Knight» and common soldiers, cavalrymen and foot soldiers, Jack tars and Admirals.

Ontario Not Likely to Suffer From Severe Earthquakes.
Hatchments of Dead and Gone Notables Still Line the Gallery and Many Celebrated Names Occur Among Those Who Have Been Linked Up With Church In Year of Capture of Quebec.
JOB PRINTING.
Ontario's recent earthquake has raised more than a little dlqulet In the breasts of timid ones whose knowledge of such things Is based upon stories of the fall of Pompeii and the St. Pierre and Messina disasters.
While earthquakes may occur at any time, there is little likelihood of any serious damage from quakes In this part of the world, according to Professor Coleman of the Toronto University.
Ontario and the Great Lake region Is situated In what is known to the geologists as the palaeoxolc sone. That Is in the region where the rock formations are shale, lime stone, sand stone, etc. These are very ancient.
There is another vast expanse of rock known to the geologists as "archaean," which extends from the north side of the St. Lawrence river, east and west, covering some 2,000,000 square miles. This in the vulgar tongue, is called the Laurentlan area.
All kinds of Job Printing neatly and cheaply executed. Orders by mall promptly attended to.

Do you know what is — a hatchment? Have you ever seen at hatchment? If not, when you are loafing about the aisles of old St. Paul's In Halifax, after a Sunday morning service by the Rev. Archdeacon Arml-tage, do not fail to keep your eyes alert on the front of the big gallery,
•aye Augustus Bridle In The Toronto Globe.
If It were not for the hatchments of St. Paul's, along with a good many other affairs quite as mediaeval and redolent of arms and men and thumping history, this peculiar old wooden church in tha heart of Halifax might have been torn down and the site sold long ago for an office building or an apartment house.
In short, a hatchment Is the coat of arms of some dead grandee or hero or man of action, done In colors by some painter and framed up to look as little like a real picture and as much like a frescoed door panel as possible. And Halifax had a lot of such men In her day. Moat of them attended church at St. Paul’s. Some of them were scalawags and some were highly respectable, and they were all makers of Canada. And they left so many traces of their somewhat spectacular careers on Halifax that any account of St. Paul's is Impossible without at least some allusion to these colonial masters. Here lived in the days of swagger and swashbuckling and scalping such picturesque figures as the Duke of Cornwallis, founder of Halifax; Sir Fenwick William, defender of Kars In the Crimean war; Col. John Inglls, of the Rifle Brigade at Lucknow; Sir Samuel Cunard and Sir Provo Wallis, admiral of the fleet; and the unconventional but quite royal Duke of Kent, grandfather of Edward VII., who built the tower clock on the hill to remind Haligonians that he was hav-

présentât!vp. Besides whom there are governors galore burled beneath St.
Paul's—and Hon. Richard Bulkeley, arst church warden and organist.
St. Paul's was built In the year that Wolfe took Quebec. They talk as familiarly about the General in the environs of St. Paul’s as though be were the godfather of the city, which he almost was, from his career at Louis bourg in the reign of good Queen Anne. The lumber was sawn In the mills of Boston and floated up In the old wooden ships Into the great harbor still big enough to hold the combined war fleets of the world.
And the hammer® that built St. Paul’s of Yankee lumber should have been preserved and hung In the vestry along with the Queen Anne plate.
Around the "Grand Parade" that made the uphill square about St.
I aul a the heroes and the plain people of Halifax made a brave show back In the 18th century. The grand parade Is over, but the hatchments remain. The once clanking streets where spurs and cavalry horses and drilling battalions and swaggering sailors held a sort of dally carnival are now much sobered down to the commonplace automobile and the delivery wagon. Railway offices and hotel ’bases, newsboys end lumbering grays are doing their beet to make the "Grand Parade 'a vart of modern everyday Canada.

Tangible evidence was not wanting to prove, by geological signs, that a severe convulsion of nature ade St. Paul's I took place at that time, and although

These two formations meet in a "fault plane" lu the western and southern section of Quebec, and in the eastern part of Ontario. For this reason there Is a prevalency of earthquakes in that district. These formations, from some causes, many of which are unknown to the geologist, slip or adjust themselves to the pressure and conditions. The meeting place of these formations is called a "fault," which means, of course, a crack or fissure.
Just in the vicinity of Quebec there is a very pronounced fissure, and earthquakes are more frequent there on account of the adjustments that take place from time to tkne. These adjustments are for the most part perpendicular, but they are sometimes horizontal, as In the case of the earthquake in California.
"There have been no serious or destructive earthquakes in Canada In modern time," said Professor Coleman the other day. "There have been no volcanic eruptions here in modern historic times. The theory Is that Labrador and all that district where the archaean rocks exist, was at one time covered with ice, and that It was thickest In that portion of Labrador and extending south to the St. Lawrence and through Quebec. The Ice covered palaeozoic formation further south did not bear the same burden as the archaean rocks across the north side of the St. Lawrence River and rose to a less extent. The district has been disturbed by smaller quakes or shifts from time to time, and this is on account of the adjustments that take place In the rock formations. They may be ever slight, and the influence depends upon their nature."
February seems to be a favorite month for Canadian earthquakes, for it was on the 5th of that month. In 1663, that the worst seismic shake ever recorded In Canada took place. Lalemont, a Jesuit, thus records It:
“It began with a great roaring sound heard through the whole extent of Canada themselves; beams and joists cracked; the logs of the palisade at Quebec danced about, and many inhabi tants were nauseated by the rocking of the earth.
“Trees struck against one another. and leaped on each other with such noise and confusion that the Indians said the whole forest was

HOW DODD’S KIDNKY PILLS CURED MRS. LANCE.
O à
Itching and Burning Pimples SpreaA
Clothing Irritated. Used Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment# Well in Three Weeks.
Few diseases so shatter the health la grippe, or influenza. Its victims all tell the same story. . They left despondent, tired, weak and wretched in every way. They Lava no appetite, ambition or strength ; cannot sleep, and suffer from headaches, backaches and nervousness. In this weakened condition lies the real danger. The body falls an easy prey to bronchitis, pneumonia, and even to consumption. Nearly every form of nervous trouble has been known to follow an attack of la grippe. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills give the quickest and most thorough relief from the after effects of this trouble. They build up and purify the blood, drive the poisons out of the system and give strength and tone to the whole body. The following is an example of their power in cases of this kind. Mrs. R. A. McLean, Wentworth Station, N.8., says: "Two yearn ago Herbert E. Free, a young boy living with us, attacked with la grippe. At the time he did not have a strong constitution, and we feared the trouble was settling on his lungs. He was not able to walk fifty yards without beinf out of breath, and his general vitality was very low. For months he continued in this position, notwithstanding all we did for him, and it was at this crisis that we got Dr. Williams* Pink Pills for him. By the time he had used three boxes there was a noticeable improvement, and this was followed by his being able to do light work, and later be had all the strength of a growing boy. His cure was looked upon as remarkable by a who knew him, and I am giving the result in the hope that it may bo of benefit to someone else."
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills are sold by ail medicine dealers or sent by mail st 60 cents a box or six boxes for $2.60 by The Dr. Williams* Medicine Co., Bnuckville, Ont.

Instead he will don hie gloves and maak, and, gp)ing to the portable bee-hive back of head quarters, seize one of the faithful little insects and send the well-trained messenger through the air.
"Whoever possesses a receiving outfit can read the secret* of the wireless," says La Gazette de. Hollande; "one can cut the wires of the ordinary telegraph ; the pigeon does not always escape the bullet. Therefore ether means have been searched for.

As the blind student very strong, the strain of the work told on him to such an extent that after graduation he was laid up with typhoid fever.

The Tag He Plastered Upon s Famous

In the “Letters of Charles Eliot Norton” is this amusing epistle, which was written by Norton in 1873:
The other day Fronde said to me: "It's a great shame that some one shouldn't keep a record of Carlyle’s talk. He never falls to say something memorable or admirably humorous. Why, he called somebody the other day
"an Inspired red herring
•Tray,” said I, -who Is it that do-such a label T But Froude had forgotten. * » * Some days afterward I asked Carlyle to whom he bad applied the phrase, but he had forgotten and said he trusted he was not to be made accountable for all the extravagant phrases he had uttered in talk—there would be “verra many to rise In Judgment” against him—but he wouldn’t disown “the Inspired red herring.”
I told all this to Forster, abusing Froude at the same time, much to Carlyle’s amusement which was increased when Forster broke out: “By heavens, my dear Norton, 1 heard that previous utterance, but I, too, have forgotten to whom it was fitted. Mrs. Forster will remember.” But when we went to the drawing room Mrs. Forster could not remember, and Forster called down wrath on her and himself. The next morning the post brought me a note from him at breakfast time, which contained only the name Henry Thomas Buckle.

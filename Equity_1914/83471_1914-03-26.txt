After the usual official preliminaries had been gone through with, the opposing teams were ordered to take their respective places, which they did according to their own ideas of how a grva t hockey game should be played.
The ’All-Stars’ appeared in the gaudy trappings of the Shaw ville Regulars while the ‘Dippy Do;sea were arrayed in an outfit that was distinctly unique, blended with a touch of the patriotic.

The Dopes saw that it was up to them to get busy, and Louie, the captain by way of an encouraging exam to the rest of his team took a deader into the boards. The Jud g • of play warned him not to repeat so hazardous a performance on pain of a major penalty being chalked up against him. The ex oeriment had a magic effect on hi- team mates, however, for shortly after the puck was again dropped on centre ice, Charley, the railroad man. got possession and with that elusive corkscrew

The foregoing thrilling features are merely cited to give an idea of play all through, as it is rather beyond the descriptive powers of the sporting editor to give a detailed report of the intricacies of the whole game.

Among the many sufferer* from rheumatism cured by this medicine is Mr. R. J. Sinclair, of Qosen, N.8., who says: "About two
I was laid up with rheumatism. For two months I could not walk and had to stay in an invalid’s chair. My feet were badly swollen and my arms seemed to be paralysed. ' I had been using doctor’s medicine for a long time, but It did not seem to help ms, and the doctor finally told me that tlie only thing that would cure me would be a change of climate. At this time I decided to give Dr. 'Williams’ Pink Pills a trial, and got a supply. After I had taken them for a while I found they were helping me, and 1 got a further supply, and they completely cured me, and 1 have not been sick one day since. I strongly recommend Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for this trouble.'’	1
If you suffer from rheumatism, or other disease of the blood or begin to cure yourself today with Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, which under a fair trial will do for you what they have done for thou lands of others.

Kvery War In Algonquin Park Wile
Thing* Are Less Hhy.
Up In Algonquin Park tbe wild things of the woods and water are protected. In that three million acr< haven the furred and feathreed denizens of the wilderness are now beginning to realise that man, then once greatest 'enemy, contemplates them no harm. Wild things are quick to understand, yet, up In tht northern forest, It baa taken the birds and animals long to learn that within tbe bounds of that vast reservation they are Immune from human harm.
Tbe red deer have been quickest to note this fact, owing, no doubt to the higher Intelligence of this ani mal. At any rate, they have beer flret to respond to the friendly over tures of the park rangers, and foi the past three years have hung close to the habitations in the park’s bor der during the season of deep snow Last winter a herd of deer strayed almost constantly within a few bun dred yards of the big hotel on Cache Lake. Three years ago winter vlsi tors to the park found It next to impossible to even decry à deer following winter one or two timid does sought shelter from the wolves In the fringe of forest directly be bind the Inn, and the following winter they returned in strengthened numbers.
Mr. Colson, manager of the Highland Inn, who Is a great lover of the wild animal» and bird», tell» of how the flret of the deer came into the clearing. It waa on a clear, cold night with the enow lying deep throughout the forest, and the mercury many degree» below zero, that he was aroused from sleep by the death cry of those gaunt night prowlers, the wolves, sounding but a little distance into the woods. Next morning two Jaded and hungry does
feeding from a pile of straw, close beside bis outbuildings.
As be approached them, they withdrew a little way into the forest, only to return again almost Immediately.
Mr. Colson, remembering the cry of the wolf pack, went forward into the timber to Investigate, and scarcely two hundred yards off tbe trail he came across the body of a buck.
Its throat cut clean by the fangs of the animals, who were too cowardly to wait and feast on their kill.
Some day. Algonquin Park will be quite as noted as famous Yellowstone Park, that wonderful reservation to which thousands of nature students and wild bird and animal lovers sojourn each year.
The wild things of Algonquin are beginning to look upon man as a protector and a friend; but it will take a little time to weed out a suspicion that has been fostered through long ages. But the deer have accepted the palm leaf, the ruffed grouse have decided in their shy way that it Is safe to show them-

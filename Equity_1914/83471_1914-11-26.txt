A farmer said he rid his farm of rats as follows "On a very large number of pieces of old shingles 1 put a teaspoonful of molasses, and on that, with my pocket knife I scraped a small amount of concentrated lye, then placed the shingles around on the floors and under the cribs. The next morning I found forty dead rats and the rest vamoosed. I have cleared farms of the pest in the same way. and have never known it fail.”

The loose collection taken up at the patriotic meeting, on the 16th, to which reference was made in our last issue, amounted to over sixty dollars, which is a pretty good evidence that the audience was heartily in sympathy with the movement to assist the Red Cross Society in its noble, humane work. With the branch society organized here as a basis of operations, there is a good reason to hope and ex ( that the contributions which will flow in, id; the form of money and supplies, will reflect credit upon the generosity of the neighborhood. Not only is ranch required in the line of comforts to alleviate the sufferings of those who are facing the untold peril* of the battlefield, but immense «tone are needed to keep the ten* of thousands, who have been rendered homeless and destitute, from |x»n*bing of cold and hunger, during the winter just set in Kveryone should contribute what they can afford—it matters not how little— to ameliorate this ap-IMilling condition.

When General Yr n Kmmich, the leader of the Gei nan army, found that after two weeks he wan still outside Liege be shot himself, says Ideas, for lie knew he had failed in his and his Kaiser s j>urj>ofte, and he had g(x;d reason also to know of his master's tyrannical cruelty to thei€ who suffered reverse.
In Ch'na life is held very cheaply, and it is considered that there are greater things for mankind to lose than life, and h-jnor is one of them. This is so all the world over.
The Kaiser gave his army two weeks to get to Paris, and at the end of that t'me they had not conquered Lieg’, and to day their chances of visiting Paris are extremely small, unless it is in the guise of prisoners.

Others, however, are not so o#b vioun. Perhaps the most extraordinary ci aill these names is “Pontius Pilate's Bodyguard," to which all ranks of the Royal Scots Regiment cheerfully answer. This regiment claims to 'be the oldest in our army, a claim, by the way that is etrenroudy resisted by certain other corps. When it was serving under the King of France in the seventeenth century, a dispute aros? between the men and those of the Picardy Regiment as to which was the oldest corps. The Picardy Regiment laid claim to having been on duty the night before the Crucifixion. To tliis the Royal Scots promptly retorted : “Had we been on duty then, we sliould not have been found asleep at our posts.”
Another nickname that needs explanation is that of the Norfolk Regiment, which is known throughout the sen ice ae “the Holy Boys. This arose during the Peninsular War from the fact that their badge is the figure of Britannia. The ignorant Spanish peasantry could not understand whom this figure was intended to represent, and took it to be the Virgin Mary.

We have no doubt it does. One out of every ten watches that fail to give their owners satisfaction need cleaning and oiling. Sometimes the owner neglects it too long, and the result is worn pivots and general debility on the ;*art of the watch. A good watch is the cheapest in the long run, and if it is carefully cleaned and oiled once a year, it will last a lifetime ; yes, a hundred years. Such a watch is a source of satisfaction to its owner. He can meet an engagement or catch a train, and never has to excuse himself with “ my watch must be slow.”
To the busy man an acurate watch is a necessity—not a luxury, as some people seem to think. To utilize every moment of precious time, to lie always on time, one must have a good watch. Drop in and let us talk watches to you, we are practical watch repairers and watchmakers, if you please, and you can have the benefit of our twenty years’ ex|>erience without charge.

What Might Happen To a Canadian Port If It Were Attacked.
One question of Interest to Canadians, as well as all o her citizens of the warring nations, is the status of , the enemy's merchant ships at tbs outbreak of war. If German or Austrian merchant ships were in any Canadian port at the outbreak of hos' till ties, nothing in international law prevents their detention. They mai be held during the period of the waf and restored, without payment to the enemy of an indemnity or damages, or they may be condemned and ao indemnity paid.
But agreed that
It is desirable that when a merchant ship of one of the belligerent powers Is at the commencement ol hostilities In an enemy's port, II should be allowed to depart freely, either immediately, or after a sufficient term of grace.”
This "period of grace" has varied from twenty-four hours to thirty days, and Great Britain has for bal{

li.%cta not only young children, but I a men and women as well. The only I 1 cure lies in plenty of pure blood. | " because good blood is the life food of the nerves. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills euro the most severe cases of St. Vitus dance, because they actually make the rich, red blood that feeds and restores the starving, shattered nerves. This has been proved in hundreds of cases, among them that of Mrs. John Duncan, London, Ont., who says :
About a year ago I found myself becoming very nervous. At the out *ct 1 did not pay much attention to it as I thought tho trouble would pass away. In this I was disappointed, for I soon found myself rapidly growing worse. My right, arm and leg began to jerk and twitch all tho time, even when I was in bed, and 1 found great diffi-cn.'ty in walking or doing any work.
Finally the trouble affected my speech, and it was with difficulty I ma<h myself
course I was doctoring for the trou hie, but was not being helped, and finally the doctor wanted me to vo to the hospital for treatment. This I did not care to do, and it was at 1 his stage that I decided to try I)r. Williams' Pink Pills. By the* time 1 had used four boxes I felt much better, and in a short time longer I was quite well and strong
ghbors look upon my cure as quite wonderful, and indeed I think it is, and shall always be grateful for what Dr. Williams' Pink Pills did for me."

The Portage du Fort seven having put it over the Shawville boys in a rather decisive manner in two games during the previous week naturally regarded the result of the approaching struggle with much confidence, and it looked as if the championship was within easy grasp.

Over a hundred strong they came, and with all the necessary equipment to celebrate the expectant victory in right royal style when thepsychologn moment arrived. This was jn

ly insi<le. The old man stared in setoniahinent.
Fully dressed, tlie suspected highwayman had thrown himself on the rude bed and lay sleeping soundly. Slight and boyish of build, with a frank young face, filled with the perfect tranquility of innocent sleep, John Jennings appeared no more than seventeen years old. The victim of the robbery am he looked found himself hoping that it was all a mistake and that the purse would not be found, but not ao the innkeeper.
With light, skillful fingers he went through the boy's pockets without disturbing him, and from one of them drew forth a purse which the traveller recognized as his. The traveller had been robbed of twenty guineas, one bad apparently been spent by Brunell and the purse contained nineteen. And each guinea bore the traveller's private mark.
BrunelVs fase was hard and his voice liad an edge of steel as he awakened the boy with the command: “Stand up, you thief;”
At first Jennings seemed not to comprehend the accusation, but when it was repeated and the landlord showed him the puree, he hurst into a paroxysm of anger, drew a small knife, and sprang blindly at his accuser. Brunell caught his hand, crushed the knife from it and flung him back upon the bed. Assistance was called and Jennings was locked up until the next day, when he was taken before a justice in Hull.
His friends advised him to plead guilty and throw himself upon the mercy of the court, but he obstinately refused, and when arraigned pleaded not guilty to the indictment. At the trial the traveller swore that he had been robbed of twenty guineas, identified his purse and the nineteen guineas it contained, and testified that he had seen them taken from the prisoner s pocket. He refused to identify Jennings as the liighwayman, saying that it was nearly dark, the
masked and that he himself had been greatly terrified.
The landlord, however, testified to the circumstance of sending out for change, receiving a marked gui-from Jennings, and the further fact of taking the purse from the prisoner’s pocket. If further proof waa necessary, it was supplied by the tradesman, who produced the missing guinea, which, he swore, he had received from Brunell on the evening of the robbery.
The jury returned a verdict of guilty witln>ut leaving the court-end Jennings, although per

“From Hull and Halifax, good Lord, deliver us,” » said to have been in the litany of the English tide v re during the eighteenth cen-Huil and Halifax had for years local Laws which made the theft of trifling amounts punishable bv death, hence the heartfelt aver •too of pickpockets, highwaymen „ and other light fingered gentry to the AC cities and their environs. But the stringent laws failed to secure a reign of perfect honesty and justice In Hull and Halifax, for some daring and wily criminals plied their trade* there in spate of the danger of extreme and terrible punishment. In proof of which we have the following story.
Just at nightfall, one evening in the winter of 1702, a traveller was approaching the outskirts of Hull. He was a little, withered old man, with a wrinkled face which betrayed much anxiety as he eat bolt upright on hie horse and vously from side to a*, tho slightest sound. Hi* agitation was not unreasonable, for the lonely rood and the shadowy winter twilight formed a setting for a dangerous encounter.
Indeed, while lie was still several miles from Hull he suddenly found hinieelf confronted by the figure of a horseman, inaekod and muffled in a long black cloak, and heard a wool, even voice requesting hi* purse. After one look down the barrel of the rider's pistol, the traveller readily parted with his money, and was heartily thankful when the marauder had galloped off along another road. Badly frightened, he now urged hie home forward, and nothing could have induced him to have passed the cheery inn which he came upon soon after dark

Sweet sleep would o’er our senses steal
And close the wearied eye,

In childhood's years it was one thing
That we our own could call,

It was a friend in every need.
So for it give a cheer,

Within its depths so soft,
Bereft of ribbon, lace and bows, Would grieve if it were scoffed ;

REMOVAL NOTICE
We have something new and up to the minute in Spring Suits this season. They are a nice weight of goods and will retain their shape and wear like iron.
With 19 years’ experience in the tailoring trade and a competent staff of workmen, we bound to give you satisfaction in fit, finish
and style.
We shrink all our Cloths and Trimmings before they are put into a suit and this is one of the most important points that many neglect, for if this is not done your suit will not retain Its shape, especially if it gets damp or wet.

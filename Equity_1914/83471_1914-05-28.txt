Mobleman Houghing it.
A romantic story has been told at Magrath, Alberta. In the village of Welling, four miles east of Magrath, live a couple styling themselves Lord and Lady Houston, who are said to belong to the English nobility. Lord Houston works as a farm laborer, and his wife teaches school in a way which has endeared her to all who come in contact with her. Houston says he lost his fortune through investments In Transvaal mining stocks; then came to Canada, where he hopes, some day, to make sufficient money on a farm to enable him to reclaim the family estate, now owned by a wealthy merchant of London.

Seafaring men never like to make much of any great deed which they perform, and, aa a result, have often been branded aa bashful, says The Victoria, B.C., Times. After nursing their ships through great storms, which the passengers believed would send them to their doom, captains I Quyon and officers are always made much of 4 by the travelers, who tell stories of how they were kept out of death’s iron grip by the great seamanship of the men who commanded their vessel.
But when a newspaperman approaches a captain to obtain his account of the great trials he Is liable to get something like this:	“Well, there

Upon the arrival of the Empress of Japan, Capt. Hopcroft, from the Orient, It was not expected that the officers would make much of their terrible outward voyage. In reply to a query the master of the white liner would only say: “Of course It was a bad one."
A passenger on the Japan on her outward voyage writes of the trip and says that the waves on the Pacific were running mountains high. “I have never seen anything like them," he writes. “Rough weather was encountered at the start and It grew worse and worse the further the ship got out into the ocean. After the first four days not more than a third of the passengers came up to the saloon; some of the passengers. In fact, did not show themselves again until the vessel was almost In Japanese waters.
“The officers seemed to have no sleep, and those who were not on deck went from cabin to cabin comforting the many who were ill and making themselves friendly. And all this was done to keep us from very grave fears. We could not believe that anything was seriously wrong while the officers were In such humor. The captain and the chief officer seemed to take It In turns to be up and below all the time. No set of officers could have Inspired greater confidence.
“The pitching of the steamship was simply terrific. At times the whole of the front part of the ship was under water, and as the bows rose up the water poured off the sides in two broad cataracts. Then the stern would go under In the same way, but not quite so badly, for the poop was never

On the crown of the hill. In the shelter of giant oaks, from which position the glimmer of Lake Ontario could he seen through the forest, stood the Servos homestead, older even than the first mill, for It was built In 1783-4. It stands there today, a plain but dignified memorial of colonial days. Miss Mary Servos, the latest direct descendant of the family, Is Its present owner and occupant. Fringing the crest of the bill, as It curved gently towards the lake, was at that early date a line of houses, the homes of the tollers, which made complete the happy and thrifty community.

The Language la Taught in Many Elementary School*.
In conversation recently with the representative in India of a leading London publiahing house it was mentioned that India, and especially the province of Bengal in northeastern India, in which Calcutta, is located, affords an important market for educational text books.
The more ambitious and intelligent young people in India evince a great thiret for education, as the principal means of rising superior to their environment and improve-ing their conditions in life, so that every possible sacrifice ia made to get an education. There is a special desire in India for employment in government positions, as such positions give fixed income and have special advantages. English education is considered essential for those who wish to have the best success, and a large proportion of the text books are in the English language, although many of the more rudimentary books are translated into native languages.
The most elementary schools for natives in India begin their instruction ilk vernacular languages and then teach English later on, and finally considerable instruction in many courses may be given in the English language from English textbooks, and in higher education most of the courses may be given from English textbooks. In some instances, instruction in English is given at the very start. Among the young people in the Province of Bengal, where there is bv far the largest opportunity of employment by European commercial houses, such as are concentrated at Calcutta, there is an especially keen demand for education from English textbooks. No other city in India contains anything like the number of fairly well-educated English speaking native clerks, typists, etc., as are in Calcutta.

Home remarkable figures were produced recently in Loudon by C. V. Dry «dale in the course of an addreM before the Royal Colonial Institute on “The Empire and the birth rate." Mr. Drysdalc said that the registrar general's reports j showed there had been a rapid and steady decline in the birth rate since 1876, the chief factor of which was the voluntary reduction of the fertility rate. The decline has been largely a class one affecting first, the richer and more cultured classes, and tapidly extending through the various grades of the middle classe» until it had now reached the skilled artisans, but not, the poorest US 6 | a,,<* mo*t unskilled laborer.
Large number* and national efficiency were not to be secured by a high birth rate, especially in the lower strata of society. High birth rate* invariably meant high general and infantile death rates, and, when accompanied by humanitarian legislation, a serious process of re-

Why are there m many failure* in the treatment of rheumatism I Why are so many sufferers resigned to a life of pain, despairing of a permanent cure 1
Because rheumatism defies any 'treatment that doe» not build up land purify the blood. The poisons 'of rheumatism are .in the blood, and it is only through the blood that the disease can be fought successfully. Unless the blood is weak and impure rheumatism cannot get a foothold. When it does the thin and impure blood is not strong enough to overcome the poisons alone. It must be strengthened and purified. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People are the best blood-building medicine you can take. They make new blood with every dose and promptly check further progress of the disease. They make the blood so pure and strong that not the least trace of rheunui-tism remains. Mr. R. J. Sinclair,

I had been using doctor's medicine for a long time, but it did not seem to help me, and the doctor finally told me that the only thing that would cure me would be a change of climate. At this time 1 decided to give Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills a trial and got a supply. After I had taken them for a while I found they were help ing me, and 1 got a further supply and they completely cured me, and 1 have not been sick one day since.
I strongly recommend Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for this trouble."
You can get these Pills from any dealer in medicines or by mail, post paid, at 60 cents a box or six boxes for $2.50 by writing The Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Brockville, Ont.

Tlio spring of 1908 found mo in charge of one of the remote trading posts of the Hudson Bay Company, at a place called Pepekwatouce, situated in a trackless wilderness miles inland from the western shore of Hudson Bay and 900 miles from the nearest railway, says a writer in the Wide World zinc.
We cut a couple of long willow sticks and secured a lantern, which we had brought with us, to the end of each. In the shelter of a willow bush we lighted the lamps, tying red handkerchiefs round them, which caused them to emit a dull red glare.
Everything was deathly quiet as we hoisted the lighted lanterns over our heads and gradually swung them to and fro.

During the whole winter my sole companions had been half-breed dog drivers, employed by the company, and a few scattered families of ( ree Indians who made a living by hunting and killing moose and deer for their own consumption and trapping furs, which they bartered with me in exchange for various articles of clothing and so forth.
Spring having arrived, all the Indians, with their squaws and families, had come into the post from their far-off hunting grounds, and were trow camped in their wigwams on a high ridge about a quarter of a mile to the rear of the fort.

Suddenly the still new was rudely broken by an ear-splitting shriek from the direction of the camp, followed by the most awful uproar—a medley of short cries, screams and the wailing of children.
Occasionally igniting a quantity of gunpowder, we would hold the two lanterns side by side in the smoke. To the overwrought imagination of the Indians on the ridge the two red lights no doubt appeared to be the wcetigo’s eyes.
Suddenly the uproar subsided considerably, and we could distinctly hear the voice of a man, who appeared to be addressing the women.

One of the most amusing of modern developments in the social world in England of late is the weekly emigration of society butterflies to the Caledonian Market, London, almost beneath the grim walla of ancient Pentonville Prison.

This accident was the cause of the decision of the Duke of Brunswick at the eleventh hour to change one of the presents offered by King George—an English made touring auto—in favor of something less potentially dangerous.
It has been said that never since has either father or son been seen in an automobile.

Hunting wolves with dogs Is one of the most engrossing and exciting of
I the winter sports In Russia, and In the j these valuable animals are still re pursuit of the full grown wild beast three types of dog are used-tbe ordinary foxhound pock, the borzoi, or Russian wolfhound, and the bear bound, a type which Is becoming rarer all the time. The Russian Imperial bunt, which Is situated at Gatchina,
I about thirty miles from SL Petersburg.
I Is the scene of most of these sporting events.
I The method of bunting is to employ a “ring" or locate the animal by means I of bis tracks In a certain portion of the j forest, the mounted huntsmen remain-I tog quietly about, with groups of bor. eols in leash, three together. The next I step Is to send the foxhounds Into the forest to force the wolf to break cover,
| and on his appearance the wolfhounds 1 are slipped. If the quarry can survive two miles of hard pressure be will ! have outlasted the pace and staying , powers of bis pursuers, but If not the wolfhounds will have pulled him down, j They can make no Impression on his ! hide, however, but must wait until the first horseman comes up. The wolf Is | either killed then by knife, or bis legs | and Jaws are bound up, and be Is taken back home and exhibited a few days In captivity, when he is turned loose to furnish sport at a future time.
| In the London Times N. Kravtchenko tells of a hunt In company with a grand duke, In which one of these full grown vicious brutes proved too much for the bounds:
We had reached our stations and became accustomed to patient motionl .waiting when far away wns beard the voice of a bound on the scent Soon a whole chorus Joined In, and a little later the wood In front of us began to fill with noise, and then suddenly, not far from us, appeared a huge full grown wolf.
He seemed to be absolutely undisturbed mud trotted off as If nothing particular was occurring, but In reality be Was traveling at great speed and had almost covered half the distance when the grand duke unleashed upon him.
SHAWVILLE MARBLE AND GRANITE WORKS IsyrSTSf^TSL.
“Let go!" shouted the grand duke, and my leash quickly followed Every moment I thought the dogs would roll the wolf over and pin him. But the task was evidently no easy one. The wolf went on and on. Now and then he would turn hie head when some more enterprising bound pressed him with ¦ his attentions. It seemed that there was nothing particularly menacing In the act but so quickly did the mighty Jaws «nip that we could only tell as one bound after another fell mwmy with ripped side# that it bed been far more than • mere bead shake. The Incredible strength and agility of the beast and the apparent ease with which be deelt with six of the mightiest and beet borzois of tbs grand does! kennel compelled one's respect and admiration.

markably plentiful. Mr. Peter Mackenzie, who died in Montreal only a few years ago, where he was at the head of the Hudson Bay Company'# establishment, had a remarkable experience in hunting these deer foi food at a point of Koksoak river where they cross It on their autumnal migration. This was not far from the Hudson Bay Company’s post, at which Mr. Mackenzie was then stationed. Assisted by three other men, he went out upon the river where the stream Is only a mile and a quarter wide, and In the course of a few hours speared and killed three hundred deer.
A drove of over five hundred were seen to be approaching the river for the purpose of crossing It, and while two Esquimaux were sent In one
kayak to head them off from the ] Geo. pRKNDKRGAftT, Proprietor shore towards which they were swim- 1 ming, another put out behind the herd to prevent their hasty return.
Mr. Mackenzie and his three assistants, in two other kayaks, armed themselves with spears to do the killing. and the suction of the water caused by the rapid swimming of the herd down stream was strong enough to draw the canoes rapidly after them. It was of course an awful butchery; but the slayers were hunting for their own existence. The carcasses of four to five hundred deer
are required every winter at the post \ Your Putmnuge Solicited in question for the sustenance of the men employed there and for the thirty or forty dogs which form part	__

forty-four deer.
Of late years, this last herd has become very small, and many of the Indians who lived on it have migrated from Hudson Bay to Fort Chlmo, where the second herd Is understood to be undiminished. The first herd supports the Indians frequenting the very interior of the Labrador peninsula, and especially those from the George and the Hamilton rivers.
Here, as on the Koksoak, In the case of the other large herd, the principal hunt is made during the fall migration, when the bucks are fat and have not yet mated with the females.
The Indians congregate along the George river, about a hundred miles beyond Lake Mlchlkamou. They spread out along the river and await the crossing of the bands of deer on their way from the coast to the wooded country. As soon as a large body begins to cross, signals of smoke are made, and the Indians soon congregate and kill great numbers from their canoes by spearing them In the water.
The crossing season there last from ten to fifteen days. Much of the flesh Is smoked for winter use, while the skins are preserved and dressed, either for clothing and other purposes, or for sale. In the spring, the deer migrate In small hands and are not so easily taken, as the snow and Ice are then beginning to melt and they have to he killed by shooting. and after a chase The migration of the second band is very similar to that already described.

The Stomach Must be Toned and Strengthened Through the Blood
OE
In every country there are countless thousands of persons going through life crippled, simply because a fractured bone has been badly set.
Whenever there has been a considerable displacement of the broken bones, the old-fashioned splint treatment is useless to restore the proper shape of the limb and its functions.
Ur. Ernest W. Hey Groves, professor in the Royal College of Surgeons of England, has perfected a system of mending bad fracture* by means of screws passed through the bones with plates or nuts at the end# tu hold the screws in position and hasten union of the bone by pressing the fragments together.
“The old-fashioned method of setting a broken limb by splints or plaster goes back to prehistoric times,199 says Professor Groves. It is almost everything that is bad. It does nothing to reduce the deformity, it allows enough movement between the fragments to cause great callus excess, it keeps the patient in bed or inactive for the longest possible time, it does everything that can be done to make the muscles waste, the tendons adhere to their sheaths and the joints to be*

of indigestion who wants to eat a good meal, but who knows that suffering will follow, finds but poor consolation in picking and choosing a diet. As a matter of fact you cannot get relief by rutting down your food to a starvation basis. The stomach must be strengthened until you can eat good, nourishing food. The only way to strengthen the stomach is to enrich tlie blood, tone up the and give strength to the stomach that will enable it to di gest any kind of food, is through a fair use of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. Tlie one mission of these pills is to make rich, red blood that reaches every organ and every nerve in the body, bringing renewed health and activity. The following illustrates the value of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills in curing in digestion. Mrs. T. Reid, Orange ville, Ont., says: “I have much pleasure in testifying to the reliability of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. For several years I had suffered greatly from stomach trouble. Several doctors prescribed for me but their medicine did not help me. After every meal I would suffer great pain, and would often b© attacked with nausea. I grew weak and had almost lost all hope of recovery. At this juncture I decided to try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, which were recommended to me. In these pills I at last found the right roedi cine, and I am once more in good health. I have much pleasure in sending you my testimonial in the hope that it will encourage some suffering persons to try this sure
remedy. ”_________________J

Difficulties of Sending Them Have
Been Overcome.
It might well seem impossible to send a telegram in a written language that has no alphabet but is made up of a vast number of characters, no two of which are alike. Not only is the Chinese language composed of several thousand different characters, but there are so many dialects spoken in China that there are more than a hundred ways of pronouncing each character, although the written language is uniform throughout the country. How is it possible to send a telegram in such a land and such a language? The difficulties have been very ingeniously overcome, and it is easier and less expensive to send a telegram in Chinese than in French.
In every telegraph office in China there is a dictionary, dr special code, in which tlie written characters are listed and numbered. There places for 9,999 characters, but a number of spaces are at present blank ; they can be filled with characters when that becomes necessary.
The sender of the telegram writes his message in tlie ordinary manner. The operator knows the numbers of most of tlie characters. If there are any of which he is ignorant, he finds them in the catalogue. Each number is composed of four Morse numerals ; for example 5913,0013.0414 signifies Yuan Shih-kai, the name of the president of the Chinese republic. It follows, then, that the ten Morse numerals will to telegraph 9,999 different Chinese characters !

a young girl while playing with her Mltt8 &Hu GlOVÔS that Will 86Ü companions near the public school of Fort Pierre, which Is on tho west bank of the Missouri river, across from the city of Pierre, the capital of North Dakota. The Chevalier de la Verendrye holds a high place on the long roll of French explorers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, who biased their way across the vast untrodden regions of the continent.
It was in September, 1738, that Pierre de la Verendrye and his youngest son, Francois, arrived at the Junction of the Red and Assinibotne rivers, the first white men to view the site of the city of Winnipeg.
The tablet, which Is about eight inches wide, contains on Its obverse side a Latin Inscription as follows :
“Anno XXVI. Regnl Ludovlcl XV Pro Rege Illustrissime Domino Mar chlone de Beauharnois MDCCXXXI Petrus Gaultier de la Verendrye Posait." That Is “In the twenty-sixth year of the reign of Louis V., in the name of the King, our most Illustrious Sovereign, and of Monsieur the Marquise of Beauharnois, Pierre Gaultier de la Verendrye placed (this tablet) 1741." On the reverse side, cut in French by the point of a dagger, Is inscribed: “Pose par le Chev-alyer de la Vr. te St. Louy la Lon-dette, A. Mlotte le 30 Lars 1743."
Translated this means: “Deposited by the Chevalier de la Verendrye. Witnesses, St. Louis la Londette, A. Mlotte. March 30, 1743." The difference In the dates Is due to the fact that the first was stamped at Quebec. where the Marquis de Beauharnois, Governor of Canada, at the time, gave the tablet to de la Verendrye as he was setting out in search for ihe Western Sea.

Bv the middle of the nineteenth century scores of bridge schemes were evolved. In one of these spans half a mile in length wore contemplated ; while another specified for 190 towers, 500 feet apart and rising 500 feet above the sea level.

The idea of an artificial connec , tk»n between England and France has been revived, but It is not a new one. For much nwre than 100 years it has been mooted. The prime minister has now desired the admiralty, war office and board of trade to report to him their views on the desirability or undesirability of the channel tunnel. It seems, therefore, that at la*t this eogrrtsa-ing subject is entering the region of practical politics.

TIME OF MEETING :
People talk much about the high cost of living these days as If it were something new. An Interesting document has come to the notice of The Toronto Globe, which shows that seventy years ago people living in Ontario had their own H. C. O. L. problems to deal with. Only at that time It had not reached the stage where it could be transposed Into the cost of high living.
The document referred to is a receipted bill of Mr. John Giffin of Brampton, C.W., "C. W.” meaning Canada West. The bill Is a trade account extending over a period of about one year, from February, 1840, to February, 1841.
Many articles appear absurdly cheap when compared to the prices at present prevailing. For instance
Thyoll of nf.tli ...» tnjjislrtat
Whiskey at 54 cents a gallon! Does anybody know what whiskey costs today? Rice appears at two pounds for It pence, or 11 cents a pound. Today It costs 6 cents a pound. Barley was given In part payment of the articles on the account mi the rate of about 35 cents a bushel, went at 60 cents a Lushel.
On the other ham*, on August lf> Mr. Giffin bought half a pound of t t at two shillings and three pence, or $1.08 per pound, the same price as two gallons of whiskey. Who would drink tea in those days? Neverthe-towarde the end of the same year Mr. Giffin bought another half pound of tea for two shillings and s x pence, while In the beginning of the year 1841 be paid three shillings and nlnepence for another half pound Either the tea market had advanced or he was getting the tea habit, and was i eektng a superior brand.
Factory cotton was sold at eight and one-half pence a yard, or It cents a yard. Half a yard of ticking cost nine pence, or 18 cents, while one yard of coat facing sold for three shillings, or 73 cents.

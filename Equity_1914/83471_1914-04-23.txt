There were good contingents from Pontiac and Renfrew counties. but the great majority of the delegates came from Montreal, which of late has taken a much deeper interest in the project than heretofore.****^*
Before proceeding the Government, the deputation assembled at the City Hall, and formed themselves into an organization to be known as “The Georgian Bay League, the sole object of which is to promote the construction of the canal.
The deputation was received by members of the Government at 1.30 in the Commons chamber, which was inadequate to accommodate all the crowd, so that many procured seats in the galleries. Hon. Louis Coderre, Secretary of State, introduced the deputation, which had as chief sixikesmen. u Mayor Martin of Montreal, and members of the board of trade and ! chambre de commerce, of that city ; W.

Robert Rogers, minister of public works, replied to the deputation at some length stating that the Government was fully aware of the advantages of the Georgian Bay route, but that before they entered upon such a gigantic undertaking, they felt it was advisable to await the report of the commission, which had been appointed to look into the rom-n isi possibilities of the project.

An hour after the shop was open led next morning, there entered a fussy little man whom Tomkins re cognized as the district manager. He greeted Mr. Carter with:
‘ ‘l/ook here, about this complaint. This sort of thing won't do at all !"'
lie spoke complainingly, rasping ly, almost threateningly. The heart of Tomkins sank into his boots. H; waited nervously, expecting every minute to be called forth.
Tomkins strained his ears to catch what was being said, but the voice of the district manager had dropped to an inaudible grumble. Mr. Carter replied only occasionally, and thm with a total absence of liis accustomed aggression. There was an air of mystery and serious business afoot, that increased the nervousness of Tomkins. He tried to pull himself together.
“After all, he can't eat me,” lie eaid to himself. “A sacking is only a sacking.’’
Then the district manager raised his voice.
“Well, that's how the matter stands, he said. “I can do nothing. I'm acting on instructions. Now, where's Tomkins?”

nson Crusoe. "Pilgrim's Progress," and the "Arabian Nights," were not written primarily for children, but were written for the human race. They are as fascinating to grown-up people as they are to children. There is a German saying that puts the matter In a nutshell: "If you propose to write especially for young people, you must not."
It Is, too. a mistake to suppose that children must continually be supplied with new books. A good book never grows old to a child any more than a great painting or a great oratorio grows stale and wearisome to an adult If we place In the hands of )ur children the true classic for hHdhood, and see th« . these classics ?ome Into their possession progressively at the age when they are sure to be most enjoyed, we need not trouble ourselves about buying for them the latest cheap, flashy, sentimental >r sensational children's books.

HERE is no home decoration more pleasingly simple than walls of plain, soft color tints. And there is wall covering more sanitary than the washable,
durable “Neu-Tone” Elat Paint.
“NEU-TONE” is the modern finish for halls, stairways, bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens—or in fact, for any Plastered Wall, Ceiling, Burlap, Wood or Metal Surface.
“NEU-TONE" is easy to apply, as it takes care of itself—works
well under the brush—flats perfectly without a trace of laps or brush narks—producing a subdued flat finish of a soft velvety effect and with great depth of tone that is pleasing and restful to the eye.
“NEU-TONE" is also most economical because it gives you walls that arc easily cleaned. When a “NEU-TONE Wall becomes ¦	¦ soiled, a sponge or soft cloth and lukewarm water,
will remove dirt and finger marks and renew the ¦oft velvety appearance of this finish.
Write for our beautiful book, “Harmony In Neu-Tone", one of the most elaborate books on home decoration ever issued—free for the asking.

It is a matter of scientific record that people whose daily occupation obliges them to sit in the open air-such as market women, attendants at fruit stands and newspaper sellers—are robust people, who do not take cold easily. Yet iUjs probable that few people take less exercise.
Let it be understood that this is not at all an argument against physical exercise. That is not only excellent, but in most cases necessary But you need not forego both air and exercise because you cannot conveniently have both ; open-air life without exercise is much more healthful than indoor life with it.

How clearly is the march of surgical science brought home to us by the death recently of Mrs. Agnes Thomson, the first woman in the world to be chloroformed She was the niece of Sir James Simpson, the celebrated Edinburgh physician, who discovered the use of anacsthe-tics in surgery, and thereby linked his name to thoae of the greatest benefactors the human race has had.
If anyone will turn to the most casual history of surgery and find there description* of the tortures through which in the old days patients went who suffered operations, he will wonder how sufficient human mettle was found to stand them. It is little wonder that hopeless death was often preferred to a hopeless struggle,
Simpson’s discovery coupled with Lister’s laid the foundation of that miracle known as modern surgery. Not only were operations afterwards performed painlessly, but the subsequent dangers of septic poi-•oaing
Simpson and Lister had to face an unbelieving world, but both by their thorough methods conquered it SB a short time
It is not yet sixty years since the first painless operation was per formed, and many things have been added to Simpaons work. But he remains secure on hi» pinnacle. We take at lightly as a pin scratch nowadays capital operations that before his day meant certain death. We hear no longer the	¦

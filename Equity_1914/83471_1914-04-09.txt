JOLIKTTH, P.Q
•‘During August last, I went to Montreal to consult a specialist as I had been suffering terribly with Stone in the Bladder.
He decided to operate hut said the stone was too large to remove and too hard to crush. I returned home and was recommended by a friend to try GIN PILLS
They relieved the pain. I took two boxes and went back to the specialist. He said the stone was smaller but he could not remove it although he tried for two hours and a half. I returned home and continued to take GIN PILLS, and to my great surprise and joy, I passed the stone.
GIN PILLS are the best medicine in the world and because they did me so much good, I will recommend them all the rest of my life".	*7®

able Father. He never really existed.
But as a mythical personage of great Importance, his coming Is looked forward to by the students of Trinity with something of awe. a little of fear, and a very great deal of Interest.
The Venerable Father Eplscopon Is said to dwell in the main tower of the college, and there, amid the oaken rafters and the dust and the cobwebs, to look down through window-panes coated with the grime of ages, upon the life that passes In the cloistered halls, below, to note everything which he thinks deserving of adverse criticism, to store it up against the coming of the ninth of March. He has been doing this ever since 1858, when the futile Imagination of P. E.
Stewart, an undergraduate, brought him into being. Each year a certain undergrad, known as The Scribe, and chosen by his predecessor In office, prepares In bis name a manuscript 'volume of comment made by one man concerning another, complies an In troductlon which Is more or less a resume of the events of the college year, and his own criticism thereon, mnd gives notice that It will be read an a certain day, usually March 9. lb* birth-day of the Mr. Stewart afor#-nenttoned. On this occasion the stu-lent body assembles In the dining lall, and after a glorous repast, the lghts are turned out, two candles an' wrought and placed one on each mid» if a reading desk on the dais, and the Scribe produces a skull, the symbol if Eplscopon, and his powers and irerogativee.

Colony of Celery Grower».
For a long time what is now the fruitful irrigated land of Canada was given a wide berth. Then southern farmers, who had been accustomed to such soil and conditions, came along with results to themselves and the land that were little short of phenomenal. Now another tract of so-called "worthless land ' is about to be taken up. Four hundred settlers. who have been living In the Kalamazoo district of Michigan, the great celery raising country, are migrating to the township of Dunwlch, in East Elgin, Ontario, to start a similar industry there. They have secured some 2,000 acres of low and swampy lands, suitable to celery culture. and plan to start business on an extensive scale.

have a very peculiar way of counting, which seems to have been devised by some one obsessed with the idea of 4he circle, or at least of a segment of the circle.
Instead of making 100 the basis of the removal of the digit to the third place, that individual stopped counting at 60, and then devised two quite cumbersome methods yf getting up to 100.
The French, like the rest of us, count up to 09 in r normal and healthy manner. Then when the next step is taken they say '‘sixty -ten, and so on. Seventy-three is “sixty thirteen ’ ; seventy-nine is nixty-nineteen. When the genius who , devised French counting reached this number he seems to have been puzzled fur a moment how tu go on. But with true Gallic ingenuity he made a buhl leap and railed eighty “four-twenties.”
Thus eighty-one becomes “four-twentics-one,” and soon, F.ighty-nine is “four-twenties nine J M one would expect him to strike another snag.

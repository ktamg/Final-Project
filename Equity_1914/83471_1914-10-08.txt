There are two ways usually adopted in trying to cure indigestion or stomach trouble—one, the wrong wav, by using purgatives and other drugs which onJy act locally and which in the long run cause more distress by wtokening the whole system. The other way and the right way is the Dr. William»’ ner of treatment—that is to nourish and build up the stomach by supplying plenty of new, rich, red blood. Give the stomach this much-needed supply of new blood and distress will disappear and stay banished forever. The new blood strengthens the nerves of the stomach and gives it the power to digest food. Thousands bear witness to the value of the Dr.
Williams treatment through the blood. Among them is the Rev. P.
D. Nowlan, of Summerville, N.8.,

When Huts Were Homes and Bede Were Shakedowns of Straw.
' For centuries the common people of England made their home In wooden huts of one room. When a family increased In numbers or wealth another but was built beside it, or, rather, a lean to was added and then another and another, as need required.
Sometimes they followed a straight line. At other times they were built out from the central but at various an-_	_ „	_	. glee. The roofs of these huts were
Round Trip Excursion thatched. An opening was left In the
center for the smoke to escape. The Are was always built in a hollow In the center of the room. Beds were made of straw. Often they were merely shakedowns In the corner. Occasionally the straw was held in a little frame resembling the ribs of a ship.
Houses built by Saxon knights were much more pretentious. They were big balls, like the Roman atrium, with a lofty roof thatched with slate or w shingles. The,floor was of hard clay. In the middle was a great Are of dry wood. The thin, acrid smoke from the Are escaped through an opening In the roof directly above the hearth.
Round the Are were long benches, on which benrtbsmen and visitors sat when not fighting or at work, and talked and drank the hours through. The tables were long boards on trestles. At night the floor was strewn with straw, and. like the less prosperous folk, host and visitors slept together. — Tooth's Companion.

In tracing the development of ocean *teamships, it is interesting to recall the vague ambitions of the designers and builders in the first generating of steamship men. They were far ahead of their day—or, to speak more accurately, they were far ahead of their engines. Several times you will come across a sud den jump in tonnage in some par ticular vessel, a jump which was not botte red for ten or twenty years afterward. That meant that the ship in question proved a white ele-,	phant, too expensive to be profita-
ble, or too bulky to be efficient.
The Great Eastern, of course, ia the most famous of the marine white elephants She was 690 feet long, and it was not until a decade or *u ago that her bulk was sur pack'd The trouble with her was that, at that time, there were not engines of sufficient power to propel her at a gpeed that would make her worth running, and she was so enormous and uttering arrangements were then so primitive that she was difficult to handle. But in many way* she was one of the best-constructed whips that ever put to and she had a double skin which once s&ved her from sinking, when her rid* was pierced—this latter an improvement which marine engineers neglected for fifty years, until the Titanic disaster taught them a much needed lesson.

Premier Asquith lifted a corner of the \ o l, but though Andrew ttouuar Liw, leader of the Opposition, admitted that the premier's words were as conciliatory **1 usual, he hastened to add that Mr. X-quith had not told them anything. To discuss the third reading under the circumstances wou’d, he said, be futile and ridiculous. He added :
“ Let the curtain ring down on this v ntemptible farce. It is only an end of u act and not of the play, The u ent can carry the bill tuent, hut the concluding act of the crama will be in the country, where au appeal to the people wdl put an end to a faroe."

Roysltiee Pestered With Tradesmen's
Samples.
Tradesmen the world over, manufacturers of all varieties of useful articles and novelties, are assiduous bidders for the patronsge of the crowned heads of Europe. Virtually every monarch In the course of a year receives goods to the value of hundreds of thousands of dollars. All the sender would wish Is a note of , former acceptance. He might live in hopes of orders In the future, but the mere recognition of the receipt and use of an article by a royal person- ! age would be satisfying.
The rule concerning unsolicited sample goods sent to Their Majesties of England is simple. All such goods of considerable value are to be re- j turned to the senders; ordinary earn-pies of little value can be retained and divided among any of the royal j servants who wish to keep them.
A year ago, among the samples re- j celved by the King were enough cigars, cigarettes, tobacco and pipes to keep the most Inveterate smoker well supplied for many years. Five thousand sample boxes of all sorts of cigars arrived In one week from hundreds of different cigar manufacturers, and most of those samples were in silver boxes. They were all returned to the senders.
Queen Mary receives marvelous assortments of exquisite dress fabrics, examples bf beautiful laces, embroidery work and shawls, while specially prepared catalogues, never seen by j the ordinary public, of varied goods arrive in a perfect avalanche at
Buckingham Palace.	_____________
Many of these catalogues cost a Nothing tOO Small, considerable sum of money to produce. A well-known firm that specialises In children’s toys has a special catalogue prepared every year for their royal customers which costs them about $2,600 to turn out.
The King of Spain, when he first visited there several years ago, received, among other things, a model of a motor car made of silver gilt.
This beautifully designed car was two feet In length and modeled In proportion. The value of the metal alone must have been $500. The young King bought it for $1,500.
A wealthy and celebrated firm of furnishers sent models of six furnished rooms to the Kaiser when he was staying at Buckingham Palace as the guest of the late King several years ago. The dimension of each room were 12 inches by 8, and the furniture was modeled In proportion. All the chairs, tables, bureaus and other pieces of furniture were of antique design, and were carved in mahogany and eatlnwood. Many of the chairs In one of the reception rooms were of Louis XV. and XVI. periods, and were exquisitely reproduced In gilt.
The whole model took nearly three years to prepare. The Kaiser purchased It for $3,500.

Quite naturally you ask, “why?” Because O.P.W. Paint contains more Linseed Oil than other high-grade pure Paints, it is the Linseed Oil that determines the wearing and protective quality of paint. O.P.W. Paint protects longer—looks better—costs least in the end—because its colors are ground in oil and because the paint, when it comes to you, contains more Linseed Oil.

Falling Leaves.
There Is no doubt that climatic conditions Influence the fall of leaves from treoe. To determine the effects of varying rainfall a French meteorologist has made observations for a dozen years, chiefly on lime trees, which are fed from the deep soil, and has found that, with the usual winter reserve of moisture In the subsoil foliage Is Independent of drought and heat. Cold is not so well withstood,
premature frosts decidedly hastening j Buckingham, the renowned Trotting* Stallion leaf fall. Different plant species behave differently, and In one year, with plenty of soil moisture, the leaves of the lime trees fell unseasonably, two months before those of the plane trees and the fruit trees.

"I hear si range rumors of mv lovely guest—that ut All the halls and parties where she appears, nnd which she adorn*, the beautiful Mrs. Urey Is a perpetual and voluntary 'waU-llower.' taking no part In dance or waits or promenade. scarcely. Indeed, even going to the suppor table." said Governor Cavendish. one morning after breakfast, when he found himself alone In the parlor with the pretty widow.
Hhe looked up In his face, and smiled with childlike frankness.
"is this true?" he Inquired.
"It Is true, she answered.
"Hut why do you deny yourself the pleasures suitable to your youth?"
"in the first place, dour friend, as I told you before. 1 have no taste for them. A youth like mine has been— a youth disciplined by adversity—Is cured of all much vanities." she answered, with that sweet blending of a smile and a sigh that always so deeply touched her lovent» compassionate heart.
He looked on her with eves full of admiration and tenderness, as he answered again:

The Ontario Department of Agriculture has issued a bulletin on lightning rods, which during the year 1913 showed an efficiency of 94% per cent. From the record* of •10 companies kept in 1913, operating in twelve counties in the province, 20.2 per cent, of buildings insured wore redded, an increase for the year of a little better than five per cent. The total number of claims paid for lightning damages buildings was 193, of which 33 were burned, amounting in nil t > $40,904
W. H. Day, in his report, e ffect—good or bad - we would have expected 20.2 per cent, of the strokes" damage would have been on r< aided buildings, which would neon 50 strokes and $10,715, while, as a matter of fact, the number of strokes to r^xided builds age was eight only, with dam a go of $54.64. a saving of $10,658. To save this amount out of expectancy of $10,713 •hows an efficiency of 99.5 p r ce.it. From scientific considerations we are led to the belief that rods must prevent strokes, but we wore not prejxarcd for such a sweeping result as this.

Hugs worth a little village in the Peak district of Derbyshire, is ashamed of itself, says the Boston Transcript. In England, you know, the word “bug” can have but one meaning; it is not used indiscriminately to describe any and all insects. Hence Bugsworth’s shame, and a recent vote to change the village's name. Mr. Wells once write a story of a Mr. Snooks who was refused by the lady of his affections on account of his plebeian name, and discovered later that the lowly word was identical with Sevenoaks or Sennox. It is just such a trick that fate has played upon the little Derbyshire village, which really take# its title (like Buxton) from the bucks once hunted iu it» vicinity. A fine modern hyphenation—Norfolk - Ho w ard s w orth for the new cognomen, but how much simpler the mere change to “Buxworth" would be.

“Such has been the case with the Polar expedition, for some of the men have not received the credit that is due them.
'The man who stands out foremost among them is Charles Wright of Toronto. He, at the risk of his life, piloted a party over the glaciers for 600 miles, while his pony was the second to be killed and he was forced to pull his sleigh and do a good deal of hard work.
He is a splendid type of manhood and a credit to bis country and a practical Canadian, and it is to him that scientists have to thank for the second year's observations of the expedition."

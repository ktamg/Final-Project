tria Recent events have shown that this strategist was riglit, but it is not yet plain that his advice was acted on in time. Von der Goltz is a strategist of international reputation, and is credited with having worked wonders in the reorganization of the Turkish army, his idea being to bring this force to bear as a German ally in the event of war.
War Lord, and assume that he re presents militarism in its most hate ful form, but even allowing that the Emperor of Germany is a very remarkable man, a Lunatic who verges upon genius or a genius who trenches upon lunacy, the fact remains that not he alone is the moulder of Germany’s policy. Like other men he has his associates and advisers, and if we look behind the imposing figure of Wilhelm we shall see the figures of half a dozen or more Germans, men o& eminence in statecraft, in war and in science, to
whom he has listened, and whose The Present Imperial Chancellor advice we may assume that he (pi Beth man n-Hoi lw eg, who will be relowed when he committed Germany membered in history for his remark to the momentous task that now about a certain “scrap of paper,M lies before her.

about Europe as to any other living man, and the fact that he is a private citizen will not relieve von Buelow of some of the responsibility of having helped his master on his mad course. Von Jagow, the present Foreign Secretary, reached his present office with very little experience, but it is due largely to him that when Austria seized Bor% nia and Herzegovina, Italy was held fast to her agreement in the Triple Alliance. His reputation is that of a conciliator, and it is very unlikely that in the crisis of six weeks ago his voice was heard. News that he had resigned would astonish nobody.

It just tugs at the heart string# to see refugees on their arrival in London, write# a correspondent. Dead beat mentally, they want to lie down and rest and forget that there are Germans and that their country lies devastated an scarred. They are too tired and heartsick even to weep.

The news that “Fighting Joe Martin la shifting hie political scenery—leaving the British House of Commons and coming back to Canada—is far from a surprise. But if be stays In Canada that will be a surprise. He has established a unique record, being the only man in the B itish Empire who has held a seat In four different Houses. He has been In the Manitoba Legislature, the Dominion House of Commons, the British Columbia Legislature (where he became Premier), and in the British House of Commons. He might now
be expected to round off his career . ,	.	. .. .,	__ __ ™ __
by introducing bis dynamic personal- AlSO & lull 11110 Ol Walking PiOWS.
| tty Into the *at of the Legislatures | and Parliaments of the Empire.
I Joseph Martin has held a career unmatched in Canadian politics. He ' left his birthplace in Milton, Ont., when a young boy, and before he was out of bis teens he was a telegraph operator in the United States.
Then came the panic of 1873, and be , returned to Canada to become suc-cesslvely a school teacher, a lawyer, i and a professional politician. Where-I ever be was and whatever be was at I he exhibited revolutionary tendencies. “He might be a good leader in time of war, but not in time of peace;
I and a mighty poor follower at any : time/' so he once was summed up.
“Fighting Joe"
ai ordinary Liberal, but as an extraordinary Radical. He was up in Portage la Prairie, Man., and made a stand for Provincial Rights, thus winning a seat In the Manitoba Legislature in 1882. He stayed in that House ten years

Waved From Death.
In 1899, having been successively expelled from Italy, Turkey, Spain, France, Russia, Germany,
I Switzerland and Belgium, and t proscribed in every European country save England, he came to the United States at the call of Patcr-I son and Reading radicals to be ! come editor of La Question Sociale in Paterson. First, however, he had to be rescued from a small island off the Tunisian coast, whither Italy had exiled him.
Malatesta lectured for a time in ! America, was shot in the thigh at ! one of the Anarchist meetings and ! saved from death by Gaetano Breach who ingratiated himself with ! the Red leader by the rescue and soon became an intimate.

With the Cucumber
i


Cucumberi will keep much longer in a cool place than ii generally realized. At any rate they will keep for three months in a refrigerator, even if the temperature is not kept a# uniform as it might te, and in good cold storage they will undoubtedly keep for many mouths They are sometimes freshened by putting them in a pitcher of water with stem end down, covereu with a cheese cloth if they are to %tand for any time. As standing water soon grows stagnant, this is not a method to recommend for keeping them, even for twu.ity four hours. They can always be freshened and cooled under running water.
Cooked cucumber is too little known among us, particularly at this season, when cucumbers are abundant and often inexpensive. There seems to be a prejudice against it that is not altogether reasonable, especially among those who consider vegetable marrow, w hich it much resembles when cooked, a delicacy. Probably, too, it is more digestible thus than in any other way it is ever used, which is not saying much.
Cooked cucumber keeps its characteristic flavor, and may be made deliciously savory. It may be prepared in any.of the ways vegetable marrow is, and in some ways of its own In France the cucumber is far more often cooked than not, and various! " flavored and served

Albion. And while the issue of peace or war with England hung in the balance at Berlin, Herr Krupp von Bohlen hurried up from Essen to take part in the momentous councils of the Kaiser with his military and naval chieftains. Can we doubt that what he learned in this country in June was hi» principal contribution to the deliberations?
Guileless, too, I remember now that I sought an interview with Herr Krupp von Bohlen at Kiel. It was the day before Sarajevo. I knew of the true British hospitality which had been showered upon him. I thought perhaps he might be inclined to indulge in some glittering generalities for publication.

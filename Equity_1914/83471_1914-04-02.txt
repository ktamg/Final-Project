The presence of burglars in the store was first noticed by Mrs. Renia u Letter, whose bedroom window commanded a clear view of the interior of the store from the P opposite side of the street. She awoke aome time between 1 and 2 F1' o'clock, and her attention was at once attracted by the raya of a flash-light in the store, I loser observation revealed the forms of two men ill the office—one standing beside the counter, and the other on the raised platform in the office. Mrs. Lester awakeued her husband, and then aroused Mr.
. K. Maitland, by knocking < the ; partition at the rear of h apartments. Almost immediately after this the light in the store disappeared, and nothing further observed in or around the store. It seems likely that the K robbers had a confederate on , guard outside who warned his companions on hearing the eligbt-I est disturbance.
M So general alarm was given, but the «tore was closely watched for «eventI hours in the belief that the robbers, finding they were not disturbed, would return to finish their work : but subsequent development* proved that they were -jttisfiod with the loot secured, S and the sum and substance of it Is " they made a clean get away with. b.stX'S arcfgg

How to Get New Health and New Strength at This Season

Spring ailments are not imagi nary. Kven the most robust find the winter months most trying to their health. Confinement indoors, often in overheated and nearly always badly ventilated rooms- in the home, the office, the shop and the echools, taxes the vitality of even the strongest. The blood becomes thin and watery and is dogged with impurities
headn< lies ami a feeling of langour.
Others are low spirited and ner v<ius. Still others are troubled with disfiguring pimples and skin eruptions, while some get up in the morning filing just as tired as when they went to bed. These are all spring symptoms that the blood is out of order and that a medicine is needed. Many people take purgative medicines in the spring. This is a serious mistake. You cannot • ure yourself with a medicine that gallops through your system and Ivates you weaker still. Tliis is all that a purgative does. What you need to give you -e health and strength in the ftpring is tonic medicine that will enrich the blood and soothe the jangled nerves. And the one always reliable tonic and blood builder is Dr. Williams Pink Pills. These Pills not *nly banish spring weakness, but guard you against the more serious ailments that follow, such as anaemia, ner

been suffering from the Kidneys ever since I was a child, says Miss J. M. Godin, of this place. “When I g new to womanhood I was told I was suffering from female weakness, so 1 tried several kinds of medicine, spending a good many dollars for nothing.
“Last winter I became so weak I was on the point of giving up my work. I could not sleep at night and could hardly get up the stairs without having palpitation of the heart and feeling quite exhausted.
“Reading of symptoms of Kidney Disease in Dodd’s Almanac, I soon found out my case was similar, so I sent at once for four boxes of Dodd’s Kidney Pills. 1 began to feel a change at the very beginning, for 1 slej>t well the \ery first night. Those four boxes did roe more good than all the medicine I had taken before, and I have remained strong ever since. 1 am now as well as can be.
All women who suffer should look to the Kidneys. They are the mainspring of health. Keep the Kidneys strong by using Dodd’s Kidney Pills and they will take care of the rest of the body.w

11 Is Thought that Thunder Is Due to Intense Heating of Gases.
For a long time it was supposed that the noise of thunder was caused by the closing up of the vacuum created by the passage of the lightning, the air rushing in from all sides with a clap ; but tire intensity of the noise is rather disproportionate, and it is now thought that thunder is due to the intense heating of gases, especially the gas of water vapor along the line of electric discharge, and the consequent conversion of suspended moisture into steam at enormous pressure. In this wav the crackle with which a peal of thunder sometimes begins might be regarded as the sound of steam explosion on a small scale caused by discharges before the main flash. Tire rumble would be the overlapping Kteam explosions, and the final clap, which sounds loudest, would be the steam explosion nearest to the auditor. In tire case of rumbling thunder the lightning is passing from cloud to cloud. When the flash pawte# from the clouds to the earth the clap is loudest at the beginning. One investigator has given substance to these suppositions by causing electric flashes to pas# from point to point tlirough terminals clothed in soaked coarse wool, and he succeeded in magnifying the crack of tire electric spark to a startling extent. It is quite possible that further experiments will add to hi# findings.

The success of the Borden Government m handling the Intercolonial Railway R shown by the fact that for the first time a its history the Government-owned road has been run with the same energetic and businesslike manner as a private owned railway. During the two tnd a half years of Conservative administration the road has been put on a new and sounder bat is, and despite increased coat of material and operation, along with greatly increased wages fur the men, has shown surpluses almost for the first time in its history. The surpluses have been turned over to the teoewsl 01 equipment account. Incidentally, during the past year nearly a million dollars was spent in new equipment and rolling sleek.
The receipts, as announced by Hon. Dr. Reid, acting Minister of R ailways, in the lb use last week, will total for the year $12,632,973, and the t stimulid expenditure will be about $12,328,001,

A Truthful Account of an Experience at the Court of the "Illuminator of the Universe’* That Reads Like a I Story From the Arabian Nights.
Many fantastic stories are reluted of Abdul Humid, the ex-sultan of Turkey, and bis court The following, however, cam tv to me from a reliable source, writes a contributor to Chambers' Journal, and once when I told the story in company one of my listen era told me that he personally knew It to be true. It Is worthy of u place among Scheherazade's famous tales.
Not far from the sultan's palace lived a certain Ahmed Ilushdl Effendl, one I of the hundreds of clerks employed at I the sublime porte. Ahmed's duties consisted of writing ornnte official communications to provincial governors For this he was supposed to receive a salary of VUO plasters (about $8> per month. If, however, he received this salary six times a year he thought himself lucky.
Compared to many of his colleagues In the government offices, Ahmed was in comfortable circumstances. He owned his own house, so he bad no rent to pay. and he gave his leisure time to cultivating the tiny garden that supplied his family with fruit and vegetables the whole year round. Ahmed Effendl, not being ambitious, was a contented man.
In bis peaceful household there was only one discordant note. The cause was a dwarf peach tree In Ahmed's garden that bore every year six or eight mammoth peaches. Early In his married life his wife dreamed that her husband would one day attain eminence and that the peaches were connected with his fortune.
Fifty times each year she urged him to take the peaches ns an offering to the sultan. "We are simple people,” she would say peaches are not for us pray thee, to the palace and present them to the benefactor of the world.” tint Ahmed would reply:
"Wife, no good conies to those who Imre relations with the palace. 1, who have always been discreet, do not wish to fall under suspicion ”
But at Inst, after twenty years, Ahmed yielded to Ills wife's Importunity and carried the beautiful fruit to the palace. There he entrusted the peaches to the grand chamberlain, who, knowing the sultan's fondness for fruit, promptly carried them into the presence of the Illuminator of the Uni* The sultan graciously accepted the gift and commanded Ahmed to wait until he was nt liberty In order

But a John and a Mary (not Jack and Polly) should always bo prosperous and happy.

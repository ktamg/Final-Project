Some months ago we placed an order for “ Hakgala ” Ceylon Green Tea, the famous brand that we have so successfully handled for the past five years.

misted of 162 bags of oats, containing over ten thousand pounds weight ! This will no doubt be a surprise to many and may be doubted by some of our readers. But the statement is absolutely correct, and what is more, Mr. F.
informed Thk Equity that the team could have drawn fifty bags more if the waggon would have stood it !
Now, the secret of the whole thing lies in the perfect condition in which the Radford road was for hauling at the time hard and worn smooth from traffic, it was, as Mr Findlay remarked, like a well macadamized road, which rendered the haul comparatively easy.
The incident, furnishes a striking object lesson of the inestimable value of good roads to the farmer when the time of year arrives for the delivery of his products to market, without regard to the comfort, convenience and expedition which they afford at all seasons to everybody who has occasion to use them. The good roads problem is one which should engage the attention of our rural municipalities to a greater extent than anything else they have to deal with.

Ontario's New System: Résulté III
iMreaee of the Gang Spirit.
The Province of Ontario has a complete and up-to-date system for dealing with criminals. Toronto, the capital of the province, has an efficient Juvenile Court and a private Women’s Police Court, as advancements and improvements on the regular police court. The city has two pi*mi id industrial farms, one for ,	.

The principal feature of the new system is that the criminal and not the crime is the first consideration. To punish the crime leaves crimes ¦till to be committed criminal is to lessen the number of crimes. To consldar a crime in its ¦elf, to isolate it from the man, and to Judge it coldly in the light of th« law, is either to be Inhuman to a victim of environment, or to be lenient to a wilful professional. And so it is that we find the police making expert reports on the environment of their prisoners; Judges listening to past records or unfortunate histories. So It Is that we find criminals being sentenced to the Ontario Reformatory for "three months and tndetermin-

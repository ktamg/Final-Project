J It is expected that every ton of hay for I 8a^e *n Canada will be exported to Europe J during the next few months to supply the : demands of the war, consequently there will be a heavy demand for hay wire, and a sharp advance in price is anticipated.
We have a few tons on hand and are still selling at the same old price.
We would advise intending buyers to secure what they require at once.

Toner ot Skulls in Servian City Was Ghastly Thing.
Nidi, tire Servian#’ temporary capital, boast» one of the most fan> ous monuments in the Balkans nthe Tower of Skulls. It was built by a Turkish Pasha in 1800 to commemorate a Servean defeat, and desecrated with the skulls of the Slain. These skulls are said to have originally numbered 1,200, and when Lamartine saw them with hair ^ still clinging to many of them the sight must have been ghastly enough.
Visitors, however, took to carry-* ing off the skulk as souvenirs, and what few remained were accorded Christian burial when Servis gained her freedom, so t-liat now the towel is skull-less, though the walls remain—surrounded by a memorial chapel erected by the ill-Wed King Alexander— as a reminder ol the nation’s sufferings under Turkish rule.

I laugh at the bond# of nation*, I acoff at their treaties, too—
There never was parchment signed by through.
They talk of lasting alliance, they speak of an age of peace,
They look to the future to bring the day when the carnage of war shall cease ;
I loosen'distrust and ambition again and turn nations into hate.
I take the men from the golden fields, from the harvest of ripened gram,
And I turn them to paths of destruction, of unspeakable grief and pain ;
I «top the wheels of the busy mill, I touch the fingers of skill—
The captains of commerce they follow rny beck, they hasten to do my will
And the flower of the nation comes under my spell, they march in unbroken line,
To the business of killing their fellow men—for tliat is a hobby of mine.
I take strong men from the family hearth, I brush the
ground .
As I call on their fathers to answer when my bugles the war call sound.
I take the son of the widow, too, I laugh at her soui-shed tears.
And I scoff when «he tremble* and quakes with grief, when she shakes with besetting tears;
I take them at 1 and I hid them use tl«>se devilish weapons of mine And I gloat as they mow each other down, I jeer at the shot.-ridden
line.
And if perchance I choose to bring these men from the front again,
I send them home to those they love as broken and crippled men.
I send home a father a useless man, a scarred and battered frame ; More kind would it be were he counted in among the list of the «lain. And pereliance I may send the widow her «on, a burden the rest of be: days,
Hut I joy as I turn the women and men at the gate of the sorrowful way*.

That is the temper which prevails. The Cabinet assented. And that ii the temper to which was due th< appearance of Drake on that TV day afternoon before the declaration, 600 miles out on the Atlantic, chepherding first the Mauretania and then the Carmania.

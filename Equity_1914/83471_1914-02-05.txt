The county league, formed during the past month, which it is understood its to compete for the Shield offered last year by Mr.
Frank Cahill, and which as yet has not been won by any club, is understood to consist of the following clubs, namely. Shawville,
Portage du Fort, Campbells Bay, and Fort Coulonge.
Portage du Fort has never before entered a team in a county league, and in doing so this year, they will, no doubt, have difficulties to contend with, both as regards getting a fairly well balanced team, and in having a reasonably good rink on which to play their home games.

That the fire loss on Dominion reservos in the West has been to remarkably small is due in large measure to the fact that the Government rangers unceasingly sought, and obtained, the co-ope ration of all with whom they came in contact. whether settler, Indian, hunter, tourist or packer. The new fire-posters ask for this co-operation instead of demanding it as previous!) ; a plea f<>r it is printed on railway time-tables and on hunting licenses; it is secured from homesteaders by providing them with fire fighting tools and by connecting rural telephone lines with ranger Mations on forest reserves, and even the Indians, many of whom were careless with file, are now induced to assist in its prevention by being presented honorary metal badges by the Dominion Government. Carelessness is the chief cause of forest fire amt by its elimination the greatest difficulty in forest fire protection is overcome.

When you buy a cream separator you want the best machine you can get for the money, don’t you?
Well, then, just listen to this proposition :
Before you order a "mail order" separator write to the concern and tell them that you want to try their machine out against a De Laval, with the privilege of sending their machine back if you decide that the De Laval is better worth what we ask you for it than their machine is worth what they ask.
That’s absolutely fair, isn’t it?
We'll be glad to furnish you a De Laval for such a trial any time you like and let you be the judge.
We are glad to make this offer because we know that the De Laval will give you better service and cost you less in the long run than any other machine you can buy, no matter
what the price.
WL 3 If you already have a mail order gup*’ separator, or any other for that mat-^r\ ter, which isn’t giving satisfaction, PMnt. we have an exchange offer that
believe will interest you.

From 1896 to the present, a period of eighteen years, he did honor to Canada in the post, and despite his advanced years, showed no sign of losing the keen edge of those faculties which made him great. Physically, however, he had been gradually declining of late years, and the recent death of his wife, whom he married in his early pioneer days in the west, and to whom he was devotedly attached, undoubtedly hastened his end.

Father Jerome S. Richard, a member of the faculty of the widespread philanthropies of Lord l niversity of Santa ( lnrn,ha^atartlej^th^scientific world with a Stratheona. One daughter, Mar-

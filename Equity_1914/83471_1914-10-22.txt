DO YOU USE FACE POWDER?

Frost & Wood and Cockshutt Machinery.
ff You Do Be Careful to Keep It From Getting In Your Eyee.
Face powder has Its dangers the tame as gunpowder. For several years occasional cases have come under the observation of oculists In which the patients. Invariably women, complain of vision being blurred, Inability to use the eyes for any length of time and severe Itching of the lids. The •lightest rubbing of the lids produces a marked redness of the eyes and only aggravates the Itching. In severe cases the lids are frequently swollen from constant rubbing. There Is a sticky, elastic secretion which, when being removed, pulls out In long strings.
Microscopic examination of the secretion reveals masses of what appear to bo crystals. Until recently no satisfactory explanation of the presence of these crystals In the eye has been given. Secretions taken from the eyes of two sisters suferinç from this peculiar complaint vrillin# Asbmltted to the professor of pathology of one of the university medical sâàeols, who found that the crystals came from face powder. Seven other patients In which the same symptoms and microscopic conditions were found all used face powder.
When the powder Is applied to the face with a puff a part of the One dust Is driven upward and lodges on the moist eyeball The powder In the presence of the tears then becomes mucilaginous In character and Is not washed from under the eyelids. The powder produces the Irritation, which Is aggravated by rubbing. Those who use a chamois skin In applying the powder are less liable to cruse the fine dost to arise, which probably accounts for the condition not being found In every woman using face powder. The condition Is quickly relieved by flushing the eye with boric acid solution. The Irritation rapidly disappears when the eyes are kept washed out with a soothing eye wash.—From Journal of the American Medical Association.

The farmer, of all men, should1 not share the exaggerated idea of the importance of Canada and the United States as contributors to the world’s food supply, which leads many persons to feel that there can bo little pinch or shortage as long as the production c»f these countries continues unhampered . It is rather the actual predominance of Europe as a food producer that renders the situation serious and places a American supplies, facts are significant :
Europe leads the continents m annual wheat production and, normally, raises twice as much as North America, her nearest competitor. She grew over one-half of the record-breaking world's wheat crop of 1913, doubling the combined contribution of Canada, United States and Mexico. Euro-

pean nations now in arms grew 42 per cent, of tihe total yield, while the whole of North America produced only slightly over 25 per cent. On the reasonable supposition that shortage of labor, |>oor tillage, decreased acreage and other adverse conditions will reduce the 1914 wheat crops of European combatant* by one-third over half of North America's entire yield would tbe required to meet the deficiency.
Europe probably carried oxer into 1914 a fair surplus from her banner wheat crop of 1913. But what of this year’s production ? Russia's rosiest prospects before the war never promised within 160,000,000 bushels of last year 's total, and the war must have caused further huge decreases. Hungary and Italy, great wheat nations, will dhow * combined shortage of 75,000,000 bushels, while India and Canada fall behind by 50,000,000 and 70,000,000 bushels respectively, as compared with the 1913 harvest. How will the deficiency be met? Canada’s exportable .surplus ha* been cut in two. The bumper crop of the United States will hardly offset the shortage of Russia alone. Consumption muet decrease somewhat, but can hardly parallel the sudden shrinkage in production. Canada, United States, India, Australia and Argentine will find every bushel of their 1914 crop required in Europe next spring to meet the shortage of Russia, France, Germany, Italy and Austria Hungary If war is prolonged for six months, hindering needing operations in the spring and summer of 1915, the demand will be even more insist ent in the spring and -summer of 1916.
The moral to the Canadian farmer is simple. Grow wheat. Sow exery available acre to a crop of which the world will stand badly in need in the coming months.
The following table shows the respective contributions of the ten leading wheat-producing nation* to the record crop of 1913, The countries marked with an asterisk are either directly or indirectly engag-i ed in the war.

Samoan Natives Keep Stevenson's
Grave Buried In Flowers.
It was In December, 1S04, that Stevenson died at Vnilimn, near Apia, on the Island of Upolu, In the Samoan group. Lovers of this quaint character—the modern who was an ancient, the ancient who was a modern, the contemporary who became a classic because he translated new things Into thoughts for all time—will be glad to know that since then he has slept In a distant grave, but not In a neglected one. For the natives of that Island keep his tomb on the lonely mountainside fragrant with flowers. "The tomb of Tusltula," they call It—that was the great Scot’s Samoan name.
Stevenson went to live In Samoa In 1SS7. lie was a comparatively young man, but he bad seen the vanities of the world, and, captivated by the climate, tbe scenery, and the kindly character of tbe natives, be at once determined to live out whatever space of life might remain to him tn that fortunate Island. And there ho did live for seven years. Long ere he died he wrote his own epitaph, and that epitaph Is graved on the brass tablet that was put there In 1S95:
Under the wide and starry sky Dig the grave and let me lie.
Glad did I live and gladly die And laid me down with a will.
This bo the verge that you grave for met "Here he Ilea where he longed to be. Home Is the sailor, home from the sea. And the hunter home from the hllL”

We have a few tons on hand and are still selling at the same old price.
We would advise intending buyers to secure what they require at once.

Hints on (’aiming.
The corks of the cataup ami grape juice -bottles pop, the catsup grows dark almost as soon as mad the pickles soften at this season of the year, which is most favorable to the growth of microscopical and invisible forms of life. The housekeepers write asking the reasons for all this, little realizing that they are asking questions which hare puzzled and occupied the minds of the greatest scientists of the last fifty years.
The harm is done before many housewives begin to think about it. There are many imperceptible forms oL decomposition which she cannot see until the food is wholly spoiled, but she can learn what conditions produce these and beware. She sees her pickles grow soft, her bread and cold vegetables mold Exactly the same causes give her family cramps or worse troubles after meals. The same agents that spoil her food because they have been swallowed often bring her to play nurse during the summer season, since most of them work with enormous rapidity at the body temperature, whether they happen to be in the alimentary tract or standing exposed to summer air.

To cut n long story short, the adjutant finished up by stating 'and the sentence of this court is t hat i h<* a'd fined in the military prison at Mid-dleburg, Cape Colony, for the period of 112 days/ This of course meant that I lost my rank, too.
The next day I was taken over to the canvas jail at Middlehurg, and was put to work on the rock pile. I omitted to say that when the proceedings went before General Lyttelton, then commanding all the troops in Cape Colony, he remitted 50 days of my sentence. 1 had just put in two days on the rock pile, when the Provost Marshal came to me, and, commanding me to stand to attention, said, Left turn, to your quarters, quick march/ I could not understand this at all, and my wonderment increased the next morning when a Cape cart arrived to convey me across the veldt to my old regiment—with permission to «moke.

• The object to be obtained in modern field artillery is effective shrapnel fire. The majority of the European field piece* have a calibre ai 2.95 indie* and throw a shrapnel projectile weighing about 14% pdhnds. This ahrapnel shell is fitted with 200 bullet* and experience shows that these bullet* to do effective work against men and horses must have a striking energy of 700 foot pounds. It is understood that the new Frendi guns have an effective shrapnel range of 6,000 yards.
"Instead of the caissons being m the rear, the French and Belgians place the gun _ caissons alongside the guns and not more than two or three feet away. The guns are provided with shields, and after the first shot the gun is rightly planted in the ground. Two men operate the piece, one to train and fire and a second to load and eject the empty cartridge case.
"In the Belgian and French plan of placing the caissons when in tion alongside of the guns there is gained great rapidity of service, and a rate of fourteen to fifteen aimed diets a minute is readily obtainable. By keeping the caisson close to the guns there is avoided

She wishes to dominate the world, and for that end she desired to separate the Powers of the Entente and to defeat thorn and abuse their weaker neighbors until England, alone, discredited and disgraced, was left for her to deal with France and then treat us as a great Austrian statesman once wished to treat her—to rob us of our own credit and our friends, and then to wre«t the trident from our grasp.

They make pure, new i blood with every dose, and this new blood means health and strength Thousands have proved the truth of P -these statements, among them Mrs.

Night after night I would have to sit up in bed to get my breath. I had no appetite and suffered from severe headaches was taking doctor's medicine all the time, and naturally felt very much discouraged. While in this deplorable condition my husband brought me home a couple of boxes of Dr. WilliameV Pink Pills, and lie fore they were gone I could feel some improvement. I gladly continued their use until I had taken, I think, ten boxes, when I was completely cured, and I never was so well in my life as I have been since.”

“It is not to be denied that automate can have sensitive organa (monometers, thermometers, compasses, etc.) permitting them to recognize the circumstances which determine their movements, but science refuses to admit that they can possess the analogue of a brain.

A team which we shall call the '• Huskies ” for lack of a more appropriate name, journeyed to Port du Fort on Friday night to glve the Senior Seconds of that town a trial for supremacy in the arts and intricacies of the poplar game, and succeeded m doubling the score on the locals, the figures atanding at the close of the game ft-3 in favor of the visiting seven. Home rather stellar hex-key is said to have been handed out during the exhibition, but all paled into insignificance compared with the fipeetacular end-to-end rush made by Shawville’s heavy-weight cover point. He surely is a comer. The focal boys say that Gauthier s clever work in the nets saved many a goal for his team.
Messrs. Bob Hazelton and Larry Smiley handled the match.

The lieutenant realizes all this In a flash and piV* hts mouth to the voice-pipe and delivers a series of rapid orders to tho quartermaster at the wheel below.
"Stop both engines! Hard n port!
Call away the starboard lifeboat!"
Another glance astern satisfies him that the man Is clear of tho propellers, and lie then gives the order:
•’Full speed astern both," and gives the lanyard of the steam siren three sharp tugs, to signal for going astern
On the lower bridge, meanwhile, there is considerable bustle and flurry.
One of the midshipmen on watch has ordered a signalman aloft with a telescope to keep an eye on the man in the water, while the men attending the cones, hoisted point upwards at the yardarm to show the ship was moving ahead, are hard at work haul lag them down and rehoiatlng them point downwards to tell the ship be- | •»:; hind that our engines are going astern.
A red, white, and blue pendant, meaning "Man overboard," has been shown Just over the bridge rail; someone has already Informed the captain of what has occurred, while on deck the boatswain’s mate of the watch has been piping •’Away lifeboat's crew ! " at the pitch of him lungs.

ge bands of men, wearing thick boots, leggings and gloves for protection ag* nst the snake bites, daily hunt the thickly-graeeed districts round about the institute, armed with long thin tubes, terini ns tin g in two semi-circular claws, which are controlled at the end nearest the body and can be opened m closed at will. By this means they are able to grasp the snake by the tail without any danger to themselves.
As soon as a snake is caught in this manner it is unceremoniously thrust into a basket, where, together with a writhing, coiling of its brethren it is conveyed to the home.
A long conservatory containing long lows of glass covered boxes is used as a sorting place for the large quantities of reptiles which brought into the home every day.

Utile Tricks By Which You Can Trick
Mr. Morpheus.
' Six hours for men, seven for women, and eight for children,” runs the old saying regarding the amount of sleep necessary for good health.
Such hours, however, are scarcely sufficient for the average healthy person, according to medical testimony.
Most men want more than six hours, and those who sleep less cannot be said to be in the best of physical condition.
Insomnia, of course, arises from many causes. Worry, grief, indigestion, cold feet, bad ventilation, lack of exercise, Improper food, and particularly disordered nerves, are all apt to cause sleeplessness, and often the simplest remedy will effect a cure.
Possibly bad nerves are the cause of sleeplessness In nine cases out of ten, and at the present time nerve specialists are strongly recommending the simple remedy of taking a small glass of stout and a biscuit after they are in bed for pi t lents suffering from sleeplessness. The remedy, It Is said, has a wonderful effect.
This reminds one of Frank Buck-land’s sovereign remedy, which was to eat two or tb-ee raw onions before „ going to bed, with the result that the Uond Eskimo. drowsy god. probably attracted by the

These tracts are equal, If not superior.

In Its natural state this land produces a strong, coarse, aquatic grass, but when enclosed by dykes and well drained It grows magnificent crops of hay and grain. Root crops will grow In this soil, but not to the best advantage. The tracts also afford rich pasturage and are used for this purpose.

grammes, or of metallic radium in the whole world.
The industry of radium was born in 1899 from the impetus given it by the studies of Pierre Curie. At a lecture given at the Society of Civil Engineers of Paris Paul Beamon has just, now recalled the fact that from that period till 1904, from thirteen tons of pitchblende residuum it was only possible to extract about two or three grammes of radium, which served specially to supply the laboratory of M. and Mme. Curie.
But an Austrian law put a stop to the exportation of the radio-active ores of Joachimsthal. Radium then extracted in France from much poorer ores, which contain only from a half to two milligrammes of radium per ton, whereas the residues of pitchblende contained from 100 to 900 milligramme* of radium per ton.
During the last three or four years Austria has not treated more than three or (our tone 6l pitchblende per year, from which were extracted annually leas than one gramme of radium.
America and England do net as yet produce radium salts. It is France who at present controls the production and the market of the precious metal.
The price of a gramme of bromure of hvdrated radium remains about $76.000.
The principal owners of radium are Mme. Curie and Sir Ernest Caasel of London.

EXPLAINING THE TELEGRAPH
non
Great Excitement In a Small VII-\ lage In Bosnia.
As a general rule, the telegraph, no longer arouses the wonder and awe that it did in our gran<U fathers. In remote countries, bowy ever, there are still people wbe have never heard of it, or who are) unable to understand it. Da» Eehe tells of the perplexity that the telegraph caused in a small village <4 Bosnia.	.	«w
The government had installed a telegraph line from Prijedor tt Bihatsch.
“What is the moaning of tM$ wire t” asked the astonished in. habitants of a village through which the line happened to pass.
“It is a telegraph,” headman of the village, who h*d been in consultation with the stt-

to Stamboul.”
The villagers were incredulous “That is impossible. How can a message run along a wire!"
The headman thought awhile f then ho hit upon the proper explar nstion. “Imagine,” he said, "a dog that is terribly long, and whose tail is stretched like the wire on these poles; imagine that his tail is so long that he reaches from hers, to Stamboul

Toast Dishes.
Codfish on Toast.—Creamed salt codfish served on thin slices of toast makes a very palatable and daintv dish.
Eggs on Toast.-There are various ways of preparing eggs on toast. An easy way is to dip slices of toast quickly in salted hot water, place in serving dish and place scrambled, poarbed or creamed eggs on top of toast.
Vegetables Served With Toast— Toast served with vegetables add* mnch to their food value and digestibility. Dip the toast quickly in boiling water and sprinkle lightlv with salt. Place in serving dish and turn vegetables cy*r it. Peas, succotash, beans, spinach, cauliflower—in fact, almost all vege-tablee are m*de more tad y and healthful if served on toast.
Milk Toast.—Heat a quart of milk to boiling noint. Add tablespoon butter. Mix t#Wesnoon flour into half cup milk ami stir into it hot milk, adding teaspoon salt. Pour over slices of to*** *nd serve hot. TTiis makes a fine difh for breakfast on a cold day. It supplies all *he nourifdiment needed ami is easier to digest than meat nr other heaw food.

THE EQUITY,
TAILORING !
French Colonial Troop* Are Full Blooded Arabs Officered by Whites.
The announcement that, In an heroic charge, a battalion o* Turcos was almost wiped out, seems to have puzzled not a few people, who apparently think they are an Oriental corps which In some mysterious way has been mobilized to assist the allies.
The confusion arises from the fact that "Turcos" Is a slang name for the Tirailleurs, one of the best of the French colonial forces leurs. Indeed, are a corps of sharpshooters, who have been practically trained from boyhood to fight. The greater proportion of the Turcos are Arabs of pure blood, though the officers and non-commissioned officers are mostly French. Excluding the French element, all the Turcos are Mohammedan, and death has no terrors for them. To die In war Is tor them to enter the Mussulman Paradise.
they fought amongst themselves, tribe against tribe, and at one time used their swords against the French. Ultimate ly they became French subjects, and are now only too glad to have a go at the enemies of France. The Tur-cos are born fighters, possessing extraordinary powers of endurance, tor they have been brought up to "rough It" from Infancy. Furthermore, as Mr. O. W. Randle points out, they are accustomed to living on next to nothing.
The Turco s staple diet Is boiled semolina, seasoned with some simple sauce and sometimes eaten with vegetables. A little mutton or goat-flesh Is occasionally added, but the semolina Is the mainstay. Few soldier# carry such a weight on their shoulders as the Turcos. Their knapsacks

London, Nov. 10.—It was officially announced in London today that the German cruiser Emden has been driven ashore and burned.
The Emden was destroyed in the Bay of Bengal hy the Australian cruiser Sydney. She was driven aahore on an inland of the Coco# group, southwest of Javar in the Indian Ocean.
The Sydney sighted the Emden yesterday morning. With superior s;#eed she at once closed in and gave !>attle. The German boat could not e*ca;#e. There was a running tight, at the end of which the Emden burning from the tire of the Auntralian boat was ! leached.
The casualties on the Sydney are said to have been four men killed and eighteen wounded. The captain and most of the crew of the Emden were saved.

London, Nov. 10.—The German cruiser Koenigxburg, which disabled the British cruiser Pegasus some weeks ago, has been bottled up at Mafia Island, on the coast of German East Africa, by the blocking of the channel to the harbor.
The Admiralty statement which announces the destruction of the Emden in the Indian Ocean, and the bottling up of the Koenigsberg on the East coast of Africa reads as follows :
4* After the whereabouts of the Koenigsberg had been indicated by the attack on the Pegasus on the 19th of September, a concentration of fast cruisers was arranged by the Admiralty in East African waters and a thorough and prolonged search by these vessels in combination was made.
44 This search resulted in the Koenigsberg being discovered by H. M. 8. Chatham, (’apt. Sidney R. Drury-Lowe, hiding in Shoal water about six miles up the Kufyi River, opposite Mafia Island, German East Africa. Owing to a greater draught the Chatham could not reach the Koenigsberg, which probably is aground at high water. Part of the crew of the Koenigsberg had been landed and intrenched on the banks of the river.
Both these entrenchments and the igsU rg have been Immbarded the Chatham, but owing to the dense palm groves amid which the ship lies, it ui not possible to estimate the damage done, {‘ending operations for her capture or destruction, effective steps have linen taken to block the Koenigsberg by sinking her collier in the only navigable channel into the river and she is now imprisoned and unable to do any further PPMBBThe fast vessels which have been searching for her are thus released

In his opening address before the section on geology of the ilrttlsh association at its recent meeting In Australia Sir Thomas H. Holland discussed all the theories of the interior of the earth, but leaned strongly to that set forth by It. 1). Oldham. He said the others were all hypotheses. This was the nearest approach to actual observation.
When an earthquake takes place delicate instruments called selsmo-gfaphs record It at distant points. “Some of the waves sent forth from earthquake center travel through the earth and some travel around by its superficial crust, the former reaching the distant seismograph before the latter," said Sir Thomas Holland in his address. The seismograph re, cords prove that the waves passing through the earth are of two kinds, traveling at two different speeds. So, there are three well-marked phases of earthquake shock, the third oft which is that of the waves passing through the earth's cruft. These have an average speed of

ALONE IN A GREAT (ITT.
UP-TO-DATE
%dventure* uf the Sergeant-Major
Wbv Got Lost.
A visitor to Valcartier Camp was amusingly entertained by the officers' mess of one of the Quebec Province regiments with an account of the three-day adventures of their sergeant-major, a happy-go-lucky Englishman who has knocked all over the world, seen service in several climes, and 1b a thorough soldier, but prone at times to succumb to the temptations of city life. The sergeant-major, | having secured leave to go to Quebec for a day, was entrusted with a number of small commissions by his officers and comrades. One was to bring back an empty suitcase left in Quebec by the major of the regiment, and a second was to express to the major's wife In a Quebec town a case of eggs. A third was to bur for the mess a meat-grinder. The sergeant-major departed, bearing the money to fulfil all his commissions, but evening came without witnessing his re-The next day passed, and still no sergeant-major, third day there arrived for the mess,

Asked why he hadn’t paid for the various articles for which he had been given the money, be answered that his funds had run low through the unfortunate circumstance that, after paying in advance for board at one hotel, he had forgotten where it was and had to pay all over at another. His excuse for his long absence was the most ingenious of all, for he claimed that as all the street lights in Quebec had been extinguished for fear of aeroplane attacks, he had lost his way each evening, and had been unable to find the railway eta-Finally, finding that the whole

A Devolve of Music.
Col. Sir Henry Pt Halt bus a worldwide reputation as a military man, but it is not so timerally known that he is almost equally as fond of music, for which he has a very keen ear and a highly critical faculty. He is the president of the National Chorus of Toronto, in which he takes a very active interest, and is a regular attendant at important rehearsals. In speaking on this side of his character, an old militia man related an incident occurring at a dinner given by the sergeants' mess of the Queen's Own Rifles some years ago. Sir Henry warn the guest of honor, and of course was billed for a speech. He got on the subject of music, and impressed on hie listeners the value of a musical education. "Why, there la music in everything," he said. In the trees, in the rivers—why, there is music even in this poor, little teapot." And picking up the article from the table and putting It to hie lips, he astonished the gathering with a rendition of "Home, Sweet Home," with sundry variations and embellishments. It brought down the house all right, and many were the exclamations of wonder as to how the effect had been produced. No explanation was forthcoming, but the steward of the mess let It out several years later when he explained how Sir Henry had him insert a tin whistle In the spout of the teapot.—Saturday Night.

It Will Reveal a Forged Signature Where Microscope* Fall.
The camera has been frequently Instrumental In the detection of ________j. In case of forgery photography is invaluable, for there Is no forger In the world clever enough to baffle Its detective skill. An Interesting proof of this was provided a few years ago in the case of a foi*- i will. An enlarged photograph revealed the penciled lines over which the signatures of the testator and witnesses had been written, although truce of them was visible through
the microscope.
This is one of the peculiarities of the camera, that It brings to light marks which are invisible through a microscope, Just as it has be*n known to reveal the signs of measles and smallpox several days before they became visible to the naked eye.
Where a forged signature Is suspected the method adopted Is to take photographs of the genuine and support false signatures, magnify each a hundredfold or more and compare

Two Towers.
Students of architecture may have often wondered why the two towers of Notre Dame at Parla were not of the same aise. It appears that when the cathedral was built lt was th«-cathedral of a suffragan bishop, who was not entitled to two towers of equal height, and for centuries the bishop of Paris was suffragan to the bishop of Sens

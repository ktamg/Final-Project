On the Civil Service Examinations for November, 101M, our stenographers and typists headed the list of successful candidates for the whole of Canada, capturing the first, second, and fourth place*.
We attribute this success to modern methods, first-class equipment, and a strong staff of teachers who know what to teach, all having been practical stenographers. Send for circular.

One year ago we adopted the NO CREDIT PRINCIPLE and have had very pleasing results.
Twelve months’ experience has proven that it is possible to do a straight cash business.
If conditions had been normal we would easily have increased our business, as it is, our decrease is only about three per cent.
We particularly want to thank our many customers for falling in so readily with the NO CREDIT idea
Their practical common sense can see that this is the right way of doing things.

Can Be Averted By Feeding the Starved Nerves With Rich, Red Blood
Sir Adam Beck 1 The new title is familiar and natural right at the start; for Ontario's Minister of Power’1 is associated in the public mind with more than a touch of the knightlines* of the old, old days.
When the people—Conservatives and Liberals alike—think of Adam Beck they think of a gentleman poli-
broad gauge, wise, kindly doing things naturally on a high plane. Because he is also rich and handsome and well dressed and a sportsman of the highest type he stands as a unique figure in the Province. He is about the nearest approach we have in Canada to a Lord Rosebery.
And as a matter of fact Sir Adam has taken the great British statesman politician for a model. He once said to an interviewer : “Like Lord Rosebery I had as a boy three great ambitions. One was to marry the most beautiful lady in Canada, another was to win the King’s Plate, and the other was to be in politics ’
These were the ambitions of the son of an obscure Ontario farmer. For Sir Adam was born fifty-seven

constantly on their feet, attending to the wants of a large and exacting family, women often break down with nervous exhaustion.
In the stores, factories, and on a farm are weak, ailing women, dragged down with torturing backache and bearing down pains.
Such suffering isn’t natural, but It's dangerous, because due to diseased kidneys.
The dizziness, Insomnia, deranged menses and other symptoms of kidney complaint can't cure themselves, they require the assistance of Dr. Hamilton’s Pills which go direct to the seat of the trouble.
To give vitality and power to the kidneys, to lend aid to the bladder and liver, to free the blood of poisons, probably there is no remedy so successful as Dr. Hamilton’s Pills. For all womanly Irregularities their merit Is well known.
Because of their mild, soothing, and healing effect, Dr. Hamilton's Pills are safe, and are recommended for girls and women of all ages. 25 cents per box at all dealers. Refuse any substitute for Dr. Hamilton's Pills of Mandrake and Butternut.

Hi
yawn
health it is one.of the best things we can do.
For one thing, a yawn ventilates the lungs. When you take an ordinary breath the lungs are not completely filled, nor are they thoroughly emptied by an ordinary re a pi ration. There is a certain quantity of air left in the lungs always— what physiologists call "residual
air '
The air in time becomes foul and affects the blood, and through the blood the nervous centres. Then at certain times certain nerves get tickled, as it were, and the result is a long drawn-out yawn, which has the power of stretching the lungs to their fullest extent, driving out all the foul air and drawing in a supply of freWh, pure air.
You will perhaps he surprised to know that yawning is beneficial to
bearing
extra big yawn you hear a cracking sound inside your head. That is due to the stretching and opening of the Eustachian tubes. These tubes connect the ear and the back of the throat. If they are congested. as happens when you have a bad cold in the head, you complain of deafness.
If you feel inclined to yawn by all means do so, regardless of what your book on etiquette may say. It is Nature’s way of cleaning out your lungs and the air passages in your head.

Nourish your nerves—that is the only way you can overcome life’s worst misery, nervous exhaustion. The fits of depression and irritation, the prostrating headaches, the weak-Mfli and trembling of the legs, the unsteady hand and the imperfect digestion that mark the victim of nerve weakness, must end in nervous breakdown if neglected.
Nourish your nerves by the natural process of filling your veins with rich, red, health-giving blood. Your nerves arc crying out for pure blood and the mission of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills is to make new
This explains why these pills have proved successful in so many cases of nervous disease that did not yield to ordinary treatment. For example, Mr. W. H. Weldon, Annapolis, N.8., say# : “In the strenuous life I have to follow the drain on my system was ho great that my nerves became shattered, the blood impoverished and my whole system undermined. I tried a number of so-called remedies without deriving any benefit. Finally having read so much about l>r. Williams’ Pink Pille I decided to try them. Tiie result was beyond my expectation. I regained my energy ; the blood and nerves were rebuilt; I lost the sense of constant tiredness I had felt and was filled with new life and energy*. I have since used the pills with beneficial results in my family and will always have a word of praise for them.’1
You can get Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills from any medicine dealer or by mail post paid at 50 cent# a box or six boxes for $2.60 by writing The Dr. Williams' Medicine Co., Brockville, Ont.

In certain country places, especially near towns in England, a new source of food is being exploited. At one stockyard after another you may see village laborers stretching fold nets for sparrows, and the birds are being caught simply for food. They keep down the butcher a bill, says the London Globe.
The number of sparrows is now immense, probably greater than it ever has been. The regular winter population in one small stockyard near London is estimated by the farmers at over 2,000. These 2,000 months he fills largely with his gram. The sparrows have completely driven away almost all other varieties of bird except a few finches.

Medical authorities are warning against ptomaine poisoning during the summer months. The commonest form of meat poisoning, called ptomaine, is due to eating the meat of diseased animals. It is impossible to detect the poisonous bacteria without bacteriological examination, owing to the fact that they do not cause putrefaction. In the greater majority of cases cooking renders this meat harmless, but are cases on record where the bacteria have survived, causing illness and death.
Summer ptomaine or meat poisoning is the most common form of the disease. Owing to the increased temperature the bacteria increase rapidly, and the only remedy is to exercise particular care in keeping meats.
Take proper care of the refrigerator and the refrigerator will take r care of the meat, say health ritiei. Warning is given badly constructed ice For every housewife the

At a cost of only $675,000, and by means of a staff numbering about two million persons, a general census of India was taken on the night of March 10, 1911, the result# of which are embodied in & large volume just issued by the India Office in London as a blue book.
The difficulties of taking a census of a population numbering about 300,000,000, over an area of 1,803,657 square miles, were enormous. They were especially great owing, as the report put# it, 1 to the long lines of railway, the big rivers on which boats travel sometimes for days without coming to the bank, the forests to whom woodcutters resort, often for weeks at a time, and the numerous sacred places, which, on occasion, attract] an many thousands of pilgri pie had to be enumerated they were caught. In the case of railways, for instance, all persons travelling by rail who took tickets after 7 p.m. on the night of tbe census were enumerated either on the platforms or in the trains. The latter were all stopped at 6 o’clock the following morning, in order to include any travellers who up till then had escaped notice.	IJBHH

The form of poisoning from bad canned good* is known as * 'botutor “sausage poisoning, is very deadly, with a mortality rat#-of 50 per cent. The microbes causing this thrive in the absence of air and multiply rapidly in canned goods, sausages, etc. Symptoms of the disease are partial or total par aJysis, double vision, painful swallowing, loss of voice and interference with heart and respiration.
With care in buying canned goods there ia no danger of this virulent poisoning It usually happens that the steam sterilization, which is part of the canning process, kills all microbes, but now and then, owing to carelessness or the eanning machinery not working properly, a few can* will reach the market containing living microbes These multiply and form gas, that pushes up the top of the can in a

Treeleee Falkland Islande.
There are no trees In the Falkland Islands, consequently the country presents a bleak appearance In the autumn the long grass, turning somewhat grayish, imparts a disagreeable and monotonous aspect to the hillside. On the return of spring the ranchers used to bare a glorious time of It in literally setting the camp on fire. This was done by simply striking a match on the saddle pommel and casting It into the midst of the withered grass. No coaxing was needed, as the material was withered and dry as tinder. Presently the mountain side would be fringed with one long line of raging flames and curling smoke. Thus was the pasture renewed. Although no trees grow In these Islands, there Is ample evidence of the land having once been thickly wooded.—Chambers' Jour-

A large Canadian lynx was shot recently by a couple of farmers who saw the animal passing over their farms near the village of Blackwell, on the shores of Lake Huron, near Sarnia. The animal, which about five feet in length, was full-grown and was In the bes, of condition, being about the size of a large collie dog. The farmers brought the dead body of the animal to Sarnia and many of the citizens viewed It. The body will be taken to Toronto, where it will be mounted. This Is the first wild animal that has ! n seen lr Government Spending Money On an j these parts for many years.

“Scientific psychotherapy has undoubtedly taken this hint of reinforcing verbal suggestion w ith a trivial action from popular practice. The device is perhaps best known in popular medicine as applied to the cure of warts. You strike the wart downwards three times with the knot of a reed as you make your auto-suggestion, or you rub it seven times with the third finger of the left hand in the direction in which the sun moves; or you wet your forefinger with saliva and stroke the wart in the direction of a passing funeral ; or you touch each wart with a pebble, place the pebbles in a bag and lose them— the finder getting the warts; or you tie as many knots in a hair as you have warts and throw the hair away ; or you steal a piece of bacon, rub the wart and slip the bacon under the bark of an ash tree, thus causing the warts to disappear from your hand and appear on the bark ; or vou get another, by hook or crook, to count your warts, when they will pass over to him.

A Theory That Flowers See end Hear and May Even Talk.
Jean Viaud Bruant, who is one of the most famous French horticulturists, has Just published a little book on flowers, In which he advances the theory (I believe it Is not entirely novel) that flowers both see and hear. As a young man, he says, he began to study flowers, for which be has always bad a passion, and be sought to understand the habits of the blooms which he cultivated. When be saw the growing plant reach out toward the necessary support be asked hisiself whether the action was the result of volition and whether the plant had eyes.

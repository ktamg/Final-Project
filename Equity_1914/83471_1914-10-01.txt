Belgium, which proved so grave a stumbling block to the advance of the Germans, is a land of three peoples — the French speaking natives, chiefly of Celtic blood ; the Flemings, or Flamande, a Teutonic 1 people speaking a language that, in its literary form, is nearly one with the written Dutch, and the Walloons, another Celtic people, descended of the Gallic Belgae, whom Caesar declared the braveit of all the Gauls. A line drawn from Liege south of Brussels to < slain comes near to marking the boundary between f ranch-speak-ipg and Flemish-speaking Belgium, though the upper classes all speak French, whether they speak Flom ish or not, and there are Flemish-tpenking workingmen in nearly all parts of Belgium, some of whom,

The following letter from the Quebec Secretary of the Association, Mr. J. A.

“In all future European ware, by an international arrangement, the hand of the censor will lie heavy on th war correspondent. He will be a mere transmitter, by strictly specified channels of carefully revised intelligence liable to be altered, cancelled, or detained at the direction of the official set in authority over him.” '
This prophecy was written in 1898 by Archibald Forbes, the man who made war correspondence one of the fine arts.
The situation is oven worse than Mr. Forbes pictured. It is not merely censorship in the usual manner, but no news is allowed to be given out except “official” news. Naturally this is devoid of interest ; it lacks a great deal that the people desire to know.

Alsace-Lorraine, which ha* always been a thorn in the side of Germany and a source of weakness to her, will be restored to France.
The whole of tlie budding Colonial Empire of Germany wil] disappear. I hope we «dial I not take any of her colonies, for we Have enough and to spare already, and, in any case, Germany’s overseas possesions are not of much account. Possibly we may consent to them being parcelled out equally between Russia and France, contenting ourselves with Togo I and, and passing Kiao-Chao over to Japan.
France certainly will insist on the slice taken from the French Congo being restored to her.
Denmark, in recognition of her good behavior during the war, may demand, and with every hope of success, the restoration to her of Schleswig-Holstein.
What Belgium's reward would be i* impossible to say. Possibly a monetary one. There is nothing territorially that could be offered this tight little kingdom, for one has to have regard in all these frontier adjustments to the sentiments and race origin of the people whose land it is proposed to divert. Belgium would never ask to be loaded with such a thankless gift as a German province that might be a canker to her as Alsace Lorraine has been to Germany.
Servia, who should have conquered Bosnia-Herzegovina from Austria, will be given authority to retain what is hers by right unchallenged.
I am prophesying that Italy will be strong enough to withstand the bullying of the other two members of the Triple Alliance.

Assuming that the German attack on France absolutely fails, and that a similar fate attende the actions of the German fleet against ours, one must presuppose a tremendous wave of enthusiasm sweeping over the armies inVading Germany which dust carry them over the different frontiers well on the road to Berlin, writes a great military expert in London Answers. Step by step the German armies roust be imagined as recoiling, on the one hand, from the French forces, swelled by the British Expeditionary Army, and, on the other hand, from the enormous Russian masses moving with slow but irresistible momentum towards the same goal—Berlin.
The German fortresses are enormously etrong, but nothing can withstand the onslaught of a well-directed army with magnificent artillery such as the French Army is equipped with. The forts of Cologne, Strassburg, and Ehrenbreit-etein much larger and mounting heavier guns than those at Liege, must fall to the attack of determined forces in sufficient strength, and able to bring to bear gun* of the right calibre, and, once the plan of the German invasion of France has been thoroughly foiled, we must suppose the French Army sweeping ever)'thing before it.

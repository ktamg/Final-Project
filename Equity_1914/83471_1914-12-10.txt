THE EQUITY,
ugnt m Ottawa ana rurnien instructive illustrations of the methods In vogue by the German agents.
The war had been on a week or so and the Militia Department was at Its busiest preparing for the despatch of the first division, when a well-dressed man, polished in manners, approached one of the leading officers of the Department.
‘ Would they toll him "how many rifles the Canadian militia possessed ?" was the modest question. When asked his motive In making such a query, he represented himself as beIng connected with a British armament firm, which could readily replenish any paucity In the domestic supply, but, of course, would like to know all about our rifle equipment, the ammunition used, and amount of It and rifles on hand, and the capacity of our factories in turning out more.
This man was no stranger. He bad been around Ottawa for a couple of gears, ostensibly a rnlnerologist, with a reputation as a good fellow, and more or less prominence In certain social sets. It Is needless to say that the Information sought was not forthcoming, and the gentleman was, in fact, advised to make bis disappearance in relatively short order.
The Instance above cited Is by no means Isolated. Just a few days ago, a stylishly dressed young man, obviously a German, but ostensibly a former Swedish naval officer, now a “naturalized and enthusiastic Canadian,M applied at a Department in , „	,
Ottawa for a clerical position. The | INOt8 til6 AClureSS ! Department In question has much to do with war correspondence.
Curiously enough he was highly recommended by a Canadian of prominence. The assumption is that the good-hearted Canadian who furnished the letter of credentials was Innocently enough assisting the employment of a spy designing to get at confidential Information. Again the proof Is lacking but the strong suspicion remains He didn’t get the

Farmers In the Counties of Wellington. Perth and Huron reported to Ottawa the erection of certain towers at long distances apart on which lights were seen at night
It was suspected that this was a signal system used by alien eneml within the country.

The lights were placed on the towers at night to lablish accurate distances.

Of the first lot, 107 were in bloom on Jan. 8, and blooming ended on Jan. 16, while the first berries were mar-tured on Feb. 21, and the last on March 16. In the second lot, with only thirty-three in bloom on Jan. 8, blooming ended on Jan. 20, maturity being reach'd from March 6 to April 1ft.
The bent time of exposure to the ether fumes seemed to be about forty-eight hours. Of the treat'd plant*, IftO were exposed for this Length of time, and IftO f<»r sixty, hours, ami the earliness of the latter was only slightly greater than that produced with the shorter exposure.

Thousands of men and women suffer severely from rheumatism.
Cruel, crippling pains m the mus <les and joints make every move-*>»ent a torture, Many people think rheumatism in duo to cold or wet it Gather, and they try to cure themselves by rubbing liniments on the painful parts. This is a great mistake—the rheumatic poison is in the blood, and liniments and mb-hing cannot give more than the most temporary relief. If you arc a victim of rheumatism or lumbago you can only rid yourself of it by making your blood rich and pure, for only in this way can the poisons of rheumatism be driven from the system. Dr. Williams' Pink Fill* have cured more cases of rheumatism than any other disease except anaemia, just because they make the rich, red blood that goes right to the root and cause of rheumatism. You cannot be well when your blood is impure, therefore, begin curing your rheumatism to day with Dr. Williams' Pmk Fills.

We have something* new and up to the minute in Spring Suits this season. They are a nice weight of goods and will retain their shape and wear like iron.
With 19 years experience in the tailoring trade | and a competent staff of workmen
bound to give you satisfaction in fit, finish and style.
We shrink all our Cloths and Trimmings before they are put into a suit and this is one of the most important points that many neglect, for if this is not done your suit will not retain its, shape, especially if it gets damp or wet.

Fit yourself with a pair of our LUMBER KING SNAG PROOF RUBBERS.
They are the best made with red sole and heel.

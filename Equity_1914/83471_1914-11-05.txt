In one of the fierce actions in the Peninsular War ammunition ran short, and many shifts were resort-1 ed to in order to make up for the lack of bullets. The chief means were buttons. There were not many left on the soldiers’ uniforms when the fight was over. To-day, of course, a soldier could not do this, for all the rifles are breech-loaders.
But in those days it was different Thus in this very same battle it is reported that a soldier took a taz or from his haversack, rammed it down, and fired it after the flying French cavalry. Evidently that cavalry had a close shave.

That's Different.
In all ages the use of primitive means of defence and offence has been a mark of Warfare. When Wat Tyler s men of Kent marched over London Bridge and scared the City and Court almost to death, their arms were sickles and billhooks and scythes, and a few black smith’s tools. The same remark applies to the arming of the men of Devon and Somerset at the Bat tie of Hedge moor, the last real bat tie fought on English ground. But
even in these days of arms of precision there have been many cases where these scientific tools have

It commands a majority In the House of Commons and has the support of the government. and It Is an effort made to save those rare and exquisite species which are threatened with extinction by the 1 greed of the bird-hunter. The United States has already set a splendid example In this matter, and Canada has now passed a law by which after Jan-i uary 1. 1915. it will be Illegal to bring Into Canada aigrettes, plumes, wings, quills or any other parts of wild birds. It Is time the nations took a hand In protecting the wild birds for some of the Instances of slaughter are perfectly horrible. Take the case of the Island of l*aysun, the great breeding place of the albatros. By the efforts of one man. assisted by a gang of twenty-two or twenty-three employees, that Island has been turned from a glorious colony of happy birds Into a charnel-house of bones. It Is computed that something like one-half of the entire species has there been destroyed, and the hideous work would assuredly have been completed If the United States had not happily wakened Just In time to what was going on. The Plumage Hill of Itself will not suffice national agreement will

Pride of place among the many valuable and unique specimens belongs to a singularly unpretentious and sorry-looking at amp issued in the colony of British Guiana in 1866, for provisional use pending the arrival of a frewh consignment of the regular postage stamps from England, writes D. B. Armstrong in the Strand Magazine. It is of the denomination one cent, the design being crudely act up from ordinary printer’s type at tho office of the Official Gazette, with the central device of a sailing Whip taken from the leading to the shipping announcements in the paper.
The single known copy of this rarity was discovered by & young collector in the colony among some old family papers stored away in an attic. Knowing nothing of its Foarcety and not being favorably impressed by its appearance, he sold it to another collector for a trifling sum, the buyer aleo being ignorant of his great bargain. Ultimately it found its way to Europe, and now reposes in the collection of M. Philippe de la Renotiere of Pa rim, the distinguished owner of the world’s greatest stamp collection, who bought it many years ago for an amount that has never been disclosed, but it is believed to have been at that period a record one. Its intrinsic value to-day, in the very unlikely contingency of it ever coming into the market, is certainly in excess of 2,000 pounds.
A report on this famous stamp by a celebrated expert states that “the copy is a poor one, dark magenta in color, and somewhat rubbed. It is initialed 'E.D.W/ and dated April 1st, the year not being distinct enough to read.” Nevertheless, it is the rarest stamp in the world.

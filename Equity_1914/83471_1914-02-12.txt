t'd much damage, nrtvv about ten minute^ piny, the locals tallied Vue first goal ; Coulonge shortly retaliated with two goals in quick succession, and the tierlod ended without further result.
In the second period Shawville Welled the score, and then i onion ge added one more—their final goal of the match. Once s Id!* the local# evened up matters, maidng the score 3 all.
During this period Kenny of the Coulonge team tripi>ed, and falling forward, struck the ice heavily and received an ugly gash on the foiehead. After a* delay of 15 minutes he was replaced by Tren-outh who finished the match.
The third period was all Shawville, the locals succeeding in running in a string of 4 goals in succession. Total score—shawville 7, Coulonge 3.
Messrs. E. Davis and H. Shadel acted as official time-keepers.
A few minor penalties were meted out, the teams in that respect being on about equal terms.
Whilst play at certain stages of the game was good and very exciting, the match on the whole did not develop as brilliant hockey, as that played with Arnprior a few nights previously.

It is almost needless to say, in politics, the former as Conservative member for the Federal riding of South Simcoe, and the latter as Xi.P.P. for the corresponding Provincial riding, then known as Cardwell, but now also called South Simcoe.

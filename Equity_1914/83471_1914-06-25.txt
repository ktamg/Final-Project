Dan* Owes Kurap* lo Priest Mummy
In Hidden Cave.
There are In suffering Mexico many Indians, belonging to several tribes, that have descended from prehistoric races. Though not educated to any extent, some of them are very Intelligent and their Ideas of right living are not so bad as one might suppose. A peculiar Instance In this connection came to light recently when Peter Oleson, a Danish mining engineer and mill owner, reached San Francisco with bis wife, after having made their escape from Zacapu, In the state
Oleson declares be owes his good fortune to the Influence of a Danish monk who lived in that part of Mexico nearly 400 years ago.
It seems that Father Dado, a Danish monk, went to Mexico in the early part of the 16th century. In 1540 be founded the town of Zln-•ona. He worked among the Indians and so far endeared himself to them that the memory of his life is to-day their treasured tradition.
When Father Dario died his body was embalmed and hidden away In a cave, where It was Installed In a sitting posture In an armchair carved out of solid rock. From the day of his death until now, so tradition goes, candles have been kept burning In his underground resting place and three Indians have kept constant vigil over the place, the location of which Is said to be known to the guards only, who never leave until taken by death, and the two oldest Indians of the tribe which treasures the tradition.
For well on to 400 years the secret had been handed down by its custodians to those selected by virtue of their age to receive it, keep It and pass It along at the approach of the reaper.
Oleson says that he had many warm friends among the Indians and has every reason to believe that the story is true and that somewhere In the vicinity of Zlnsona the embalmed body of that missionary of long ago sits In a stone chair, staring with unseeing eyes at the everlasting candle light which keeps alive In the hearts of the descendants of the people he loved and worked for the memory of his own good deeds.
“The Indians believe It to be true," said Oleson. with one of the old chiefs who Is said to have the secret of the subterranean
Father Dado from his lips. I knew that I and my property were safe solely because I was a Dane.
“When the Indians first learned that I came from Denmark they were deeply Interested, but surprised that I had not known Father Dado. I tried to explain that 1540 was a long time ago. They said they knew that, but Father Dado was such a great man
known him cause I was a Dane and I know that when I go back my property will be Just as I left It. If the Indians who promised to care for It are dead they will have delegated the duty to somebody else. They may be ignorant as the world's Idea of knowledge goes, but they have the capacity for remembering a friend."
Many New Invocation* For Spécial

The second statement of the Bishop Suffragan of Kingston on the proposals for the revision and enrichment of the Book of Common Prayer, which the revision committee requested him to prepare, shows that many new prayers have been added These include prayers at the New Year, for missionaries, for those abou to be confirmed, for Parliamentary elections, for fair weather, for blessing on fisheries, for fruitful reasonable price.

Fiplosive Force of Water.
Water, looked upon as the tamest of liquids, Is as great an explosive as dynamite under certain conditions. In one day water breaks up more earth and rock than all the gunpowder, guncotton and dynamite in the world do In a year.

When the line reached this creek, a message came that the Atlantic cable. Just laid, was a complete and successful line, and was then In operation. The engineer corps In charge of the work of stringing this overhead line was ordered back to New York. Thus the creek became known as Telegraph Creek.

Mr. Launch lot Vmher of Johannesburg, in South Africa, has introduced a new dustdaying prépara tion for use in mine», the, bane of which i» molasse». The Iron and Coal Trades Review say» that a spray of the mixture lays the dust permanently. In one mine it wae found that "the dri ve w alls sprayed with it remain! d, in some parts of the mine, sticky and dust-eatching for nearly a year. The preparation, which contains & small quantity of some disinfectant, forms a thick coating on the underground walls and surfaces, and closely covers all dangerous sputum, microbes, other noxioua matter.

Method Is Found to Prevent Disaster#
at ('roes Hoads In Knglamd.
An examination of the list ol motor accidents of the last two or three years in England reveals the fact that there is a growing number due to cars colliding at crossings where roads meet at right angles. And they arise, not so much from negligence on the part of drivers, but because one or both rely on what is termed the theory of probabilities.
Doubtless many persons have noticed that a car approaching a crossroad seldom slows down, although II gives due notice of its approach with tbe hooter. The speed at which such cross-roads are taken can only be accounted for, according to a London Times' expert, by the willingness to take a sporting chance of there being no car on the cross-road in a position to bring about any risk of danger

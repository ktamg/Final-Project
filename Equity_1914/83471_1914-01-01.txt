Nearly every one has some kind of hobby—something that she or he can turn to for enjoyment in leisure moments, but, as a rule, most hobbies take a very ordinary form, such as stamp-collecting, photography, or hunting butterflies. Occasionally, however, people have strange ideas of what constitutes amusement, as the following cases will show ;—A short time ago there died in Germany an WÊ man of 78. It was noticed that during hie lifetime, whenever he went to a cafe he always helped himself to a quantity of lump sugar, which he put in hie pocket and took home. No one could understand did this until his death, when in his room were discovered numerous models of houses and rai’way stations, all made out of lumps of sugar. Modelling in sugar was the old man’s sole hobby, and it was estimated that in making his little houses he had utilized no fewer than 10,000 lumps of sugar There is, in America, a married couple named Vernon, whose hoh

"The Father," as the late King of Denmark was usually termed. as well as the "Father Francis" by which the Emperor of Austria Is known, are evidence of the depth of affection and reverence shown to each by their subjects.
But the late King Leopold of Belgium had to content himself with the very unflattering title of "The King with a Nose."

Preparation and Proper!lea of the Two Different Prod arts.
To many persona the "cement" and the "concrete" that nowadays enter so largely Into building construction are synonymous terms. They are by no means the same thing.
In the first place, Portland cement Is a manufactured product obtained from lime rock and clay or similar aluminous raw materials. Its preparation Involves drying, burning and grinding In order that, when finished, It shall be In the form of a light gray powder or flour. This powder Is of such exceeding fineness that the grains thereof may be made to pass through a sieve containing 40,000 holes to the square inch of surface.
Modeled into any deslrgble form, cement shows a high crushing resistance, together with a high tensile strength. It will sustain almost any load without Injury to Itself, showing no cracks or other elements of decay that attack other materials.
"Concrete" Implies the use of cement In conjunction with sand and crushed rock and In such proportions as will develop the highest value of the cement for practical purposes, at the same time bringing It within the range of buyers who do not wish to employ Portland cement.
"Re-enforced concrete" means the use of concrete In conjunction with steel so placed as to contribute the tenslonal value of the steel to the total mass. Columns thus constructed will sustain almost any concentrated burden and are being extensively used in engineering—Technical World.

The Stage Gag.
Glande Flemming, the famous English actor and baritone, Is an authority on stage history, and the other evening, at the Greenroom Club, he talked In a most Interesting way about stage gags.
"The best stage gag In history," Mr. Flemming said, "was undoubtedly an Impromptu of Mrs. Keeley's. Mrs. Keeley was playing a boy's part In Genevieve/ She was taken before a Judge In this part, and the Judge asked, sternly:—
Now, then, where are your accomplices?'
"To this question Mrs. Keeley roguishly replied, as she gave a nautical hitch to her trousers :—
I don't wear any. They keep up without.’
"This Impromptu gag was so successful that from that night on Mrs. Keeley did not require to answer the Judge’s question—the gallery, in resounding chorus, did it for her."

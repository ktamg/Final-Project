It is well that society should have it* periods of ntroapection undergoing one just now. we «peak of the moral condition of society at the present day it should be remembered that society is com posed <A all morts and conditions of people as widely different as the Poles, says the Gentlewoman. First of all, there is the Court circle, and her#, the example of the Queen cannot but have a good influence on all in immediate contact with her. Then there are many people with immense power in the land for good or evil whose power is closely connected with and depend ent upon the Throne, therefore the conditions of life at Court are reflected here to the benefit of the whole community. In the widening circles of society we then reach a class of people who are ever anxious to raise themselves up into the atmosphere of the highest, and are thousands of acres of young trees careful not to do anything that will on these reserves have been de ostracise them
which they wish to enter. So we find that the influence of the Court is filtered down, and we realize the responsibility which attaches to the Royal circle. We see how widely this influence is felt and acted upon when, as in the case of our own Court, their conduct tends to raise the morals, and to make for all that is purest and best in life.

While a building was in course of demolition at New ton Row, Birmingham, England, part of the upper floor gave way. One man, luckily, got clear, but two failed to escape, and one of them stood over the kneeling form of the other and supported as much of the huge maw of masonry as he could from falling on to him. If he had not had the presence of mind to do this his mate would have been killed at once.
Thus, with this stupendous weight on his shoulders, with blood ickling into his eyes from a severe wound on the forehead, the brave man

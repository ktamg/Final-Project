“Wall, and who’* aha? Is she one of the attirasse# 1M asked Uk-oig inau.
“Yes ' assented Dolly, vigorously nodding her head, “And she's Minnie Vining.”
The big man scratched his head for a thoughtful moment. Then he buddeuly remembered.
“Why. that’s the private name of tlie leading lady/' he remembered. “Go round the ra to the eta go-door and a-sk for her, lilt e un. But she’ll be acting now, eu you'll have to wait for her.”
Dolly ran round to Ac stage -door. 8he did not u n<l >-etc r d what the man meant when ho raid her mother would be acting ; indeed, Arthur Vining had been determined to keep his girl in utter ignorance of her mother's profession. But Dolly was now too eager and excited to csk more questions.
She lie situ ted only a moment at the stage door, which harp?ned to be open; thnn. with chi dish ignorance, she walked into the narrow pas' age.	4
Everything wa* strange to her, and her first thought was that her mother must now be living in a \#ry big house.
“It's the very biggest house I ever saw,” said Dolly, walking along the corridor, &*id passing several doors on Her right and her left. ”My, what a great big painting !"
She stared with awe at some side wings, stacked away against the wall. But no one accosted her, for the play was in progress, and everyone who saw the child was too busy to troub’e themselves as to whom she might bo.
“What a lot of rooms there arc in this great big house to herself, at il ! wandering on. “And what a lot of men go about in shirt-sleeves Î My, isn't it windy !”
She was approaching the stage, and the draught that blew between the side wings was fanning her face. She stared up in amazement at the limelight man.
“There’s a gentleman doing a magic-lantern,” she told herself. “Oh, what a queer, funny house mother’s living in now !”
A stage carpenter nearly knocked her over a moment later, and it lucky she did not understand the word which he flung at her in his anger. But Dolly hurried on, and presently, with a little cry of astonishment, she came within view of tlie stage.
There she stood, in the aid-wings, drinking in the scene before her. She saw her mot he r—h e r own darling mother—sitting at a table with a fine, handsome gentleman. And ju#t at her mother's feet nestled a pretty little child.
Dolly stared with more amaze ment than ever. She did not understand what acting was, and she thought this was the big room of a large house, in which she had found her mother with a gentleman and a little girl. Very carefully she listened to what they were saying.
“My darling wife 1 Need I tell you how much I love you ? the gentleman said to Dolly's mother. And Dolly saw him lift her mother's wrist to his lips and kise it.
“But my mother’s not his wife ' She's my daddy’s wife!” broke from the child almost audibly. Bow dare he say that my n her

Thin blooded people do not re-1 moderately good vision, main mo from choice, but from indifference ; in some cases from de-sf*aiir	People who are pale, lan-
guid, with palpitation of the heart, some difficulty in breathing and a tendency to be easily tired are suffering from thin blood. They need only the resolution to take the right treatment and stick to it until cured. The remedy that can be relied upon is Dr. Williams' Pink PilJa for Pale People. With every dose they make new blood, and new blood means health and strength.
The red checks, good appetite, increasing weight and strength that fojlow the use of these Pills prove >their great value to thin-blooded people. Here is an example : Mrs It. Steele, A f ton Rond, P.E.L, says: “ Following childbirth I took a pain in my head which grew so bad I had to call in a doctor. He told me that my blood had turned to water and that I was in a serious condition He treated me four months, but still the pain remained. and my condition was growing pitiable. I lost my appetite, and waa so weak and run down that I could no more than walk across a room. I was as pale as a corpse, and the doctor told my friends ho had but little hopes of my getting better. A cousin who came to see me urged me to try Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills, and I sent and got a supply. In about a month after beginning their use I had much relief, and by the time I had taken mx more boxes I was fully cured and felt as well as ever I did in ray life. I have never had a twinge of the pain tance, and feel that I owe my life to Dr. Williams’ Pink Pilla, as they cured me after the doctor bad failed."

A report from M de Kruyff, of he Dutch Agricultural Bureau at Tultenzorg, Java, pointe the way to •ral success in rat killing He tried he modern method of giving a con sigious disease to one rat in the lope that all would die. This proved useless. Finally, de Kruyff upon a novel use of carbon disul-oiiide. All visible rat holes were first stopped with earth to ascertain which holes were inhabited, for the inhabited holes were found re opened on the following dav. Half a tesapoonful of carbon d sulphide was poured in each of these holes, and after waiting a few seconde to allow the liquid to evaporate, the mixture of vapor and air was ignited. The resulting email explosion filled the hole with poisonous gases and killed all the rats almost instantly.—Scientific American.

With 19 years’ experience in the tailoring trade and a competent staff of workmen, we are bound to give you satisfaction in fit, finish and style.
We shrink all our Cloths and Trimmings before they are put into a suit and this is one of the most important points that many neglect, for if this is not done your suit will not retain its shape, especially if it gets damp or wet.

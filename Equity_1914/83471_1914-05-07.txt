Measurements taken of 600 German children on entering school and again two months litter revealed, according to this writer, that twenty per cent, of the children had lost weight. This Is especially significant, he says, because of the ages of the children—they were between five and six —and of the season of the year. The measurements were taken In the autumn season, which normally Is the Season of most rapid growth.

Quite naturally you ask, “why?” Because O.P.W. Paint contains more Linseed Oil than other high-grade pure Paints. It is the Linseed Oil that determines the wearing and protective quality of paint. O.P. W. Paint protects longer—looks better—costs least in the end—because its colors are ground in oil and because the paint, when it comes to you, contains more Linseed Oil.

Hot Baths.
By causing the blood to circulate more freely and dilating the vessels on the surface hot baths relieve the congestion ' In the muscles and Internal organs. In this way they promote the elim lnation of the waste products which cause tiredness, fatigue and most of the other aches and pains from which tired bumani ty Is liable to suffer. It Is not necessary to wait until bedtime before having a hot bath Its most beneficial effects can be obtained by taking It In the evening on returning from work It Is then that IS Is most refresh lng and If made use of at this time of day will enable many a man who has come home fagged out to spend on enjoyable evening when otherwise he would be sitting down too tired to read or take part In any amusement.

The youthful widow smiled faint I v as she answered:

The boat touched the stairs leading up to a little landing-house. Mr. Lvle got out first, and with a verv kind smile and bow reached down his hand to help the child In widow's weeds out of the boat.
With a glance full of sweetness she th*nked him.

The childlike face changed, the soft, dark eyes filled with tears, the lender lips trembled, but the young creature did not answer.

Vital changes in (he *v*-tem, after long winter month», may oau»»e much more trouble than the familiar spring weakness and we&ri-nets fmm which nuwt people suffer a* the result of indoor life, in poorly ventilated ami often overheated buildings. Official record» prove that in April and May neuralgia, Ht.

Tiie antiquated custom of taking purgatives in the spring is useless, for the system really needs strengthening, while purgatives only gallop through the bowels, leaving you weaker. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills are the beat medicine, for they actually make the new, rich, red bhxxl that feeds the etarved nerves, and thus cure the many forms of nervous disorders. They cure al*o such other forms of spring trouble» a» headache*, poor appe- ] life, weakness in tffie limbs, a® weW as remove tvneightly pinède* and i eru|>tions. In fact they unfailingly bring new health and strength to weak, tired and depressed men, women and children.	'

It is expected that every ton of hay for sale in Canada will be exported to Europe during the next few months to supply the demands of the war, consequently there will be a heavy demand for hay wire, and a sharp I advance in price is anticipated.
We have a few tons on hand and are still selling at the same old price.
We would advise intending buyers to secure what they require at once.

With Grapes.
I invoked Grape Juive. — Pick Concord grapes from stems, wash thoroughly, and crush. Squeeze and strain the juice through dou le cl se -til with or without sweetening three teaspoons of sugar glass of this most delicious juice brings out ltd flavor. This is far better than orange juice, and, like it, must always be freshly made. After squeezing out the juice the skin and pulp may be put in a preserving kettle, barely covered with cold water, and cooked till whole grapes would burst. Strain and use this juice for jelly or to drink.
Grape Jell)
fine purple grapes grapes make a jelly much preferred by some people, but from any Concord grape, this early in the season may be made a jelly almost as light, 'red, and clear as currant jelly, although if not carefully made it will be a dark, dull purple. Prepare the grapes just as for cooked grape juice, but cook them for a few minutes longer, since the jelly ing orinciple is in the skin and cooking develops this. Quite as satisfactory jelly, and more of it, can be made by using a little water, although some people crush the grapes and cook them in their own juice. Vse about fourteen ounces of sugar to each pint of juice. Do not cook over twenty minutes, and ten may do. Gentle cooking is much more effective than stronger.
Chill Sauce. Twenty-four large, t ripe tomatoes ; six green peppers ; ' four large onions. Chop these ingredients. then add three table spoons of salt, two and a half cups of vinegar (or five teacups, which hold about half a standard cup), one half cup of brown sugar. A little more sugar than this can he added, if to taste. Cook slowly from one-half hour to two hours. I Watch carefully, and stir toward the last, if necessary. If the fire is low enough after the boiling point has once been reached it will not stick on. If a spiced sauce is desired. add one tablespoon of cinnamon, one tablespoon of allspice, one half tablespoon of cloven, and one-half tablespoon of nutmeg.
Grapes Dipped iu Fondant.- The Tokay grapes are perhaps the finest for this purpose. So prepared they resemble a liquid tilled bonbon. \\ ash the grapes and with the scissors cut each one from the main stem, leaving a little stem on each. Thoroughly dry every one on a cloth before dipping it in the melted fondant. Dry in little fancy pa a per forms or on a greased plate Make the fondant of two cups cl sugar and three-fourths of a cup of water w ith a ninch of cream tartar or a few drops of lemon juice added when the sugar begins to boil. Stir the sugar and water together until thoroughly dissolved, bring •lowly to a boil, and boil over a low fire to soft ball stage or to 210 degrees bv the candy thermometer. With this amount of water, over just enough tire to keep up the boiling, the cooking will take ten minutes. Remove from fire and when bubbling ceases pour on a wet or a greased platter. When half cooled through and through commence to work toward the centre

THE BEAUTIFUL CITY OF LOUVAIN, DESTROYED BY THE GERMANS
Ha l at lx>m tin, Belgium. This lovely city was utterly destroyed by the Germans in reprisal fur the shooting of some German soldiers by civilians. Buildings centuries old, filled with*' priceless relics of antiquity, were levelled to the ground by these modern Goths and vandals. Six hundred years ago this city, w ith its population of 50,000. was the most important industrial centre in this part of Europe. Enormous quantities of woollen and linen cloth were woven here and exported to all parts of Europe. In 1378 there was a riot in this square and thirteen magistrates of noble family killed. The building shown here was, when erected, practically a huge illustrated Bible and town history spread open to the eyes of all the people before there were any printed books

When it is #'iid that Germany s only possible chance tj win is by a short war, it is meant that in a long struggle the combined resources of the allies' are superior to those of Germany, and that in the end they would inevitably tell, no matter with w hat genius the German forces were handled. In a long war, with Germany unable to import foodstuffs, the result is no more open to argument than is the assertion that a bag of flour is heavier than half a bag. The German army might destroy nine-tenths of tlie soldiers rent against them, but some one has made the remark that an army fights on its belly, and if the victorious Germans found that their army would be starved and that their people were already starving, there would be nothing to do but to surrender and accept whatever terms, abort of starvation, might be imposed by the powers that, from the point of view of actual engagement», had been defeated.

Before the wool is spun Into yarn for Stanfield's Unshrinkable Underwear it is washed, scoured, picked and combed many times. After the garments are knit they must undergo another series of vigorous washings making every garment beautifully clean and sanitary.
Test Stanfield's 1 nshrinkable Underwear ns severely as you will it can’t possibly shrink because these vigorous laundry tests make it so.
You won't find any weak spots or dropped stitches in Stanfield’s Unshrinkable Underwear. Every garment must pass a most rigid examination before it leaves the factory.	,
Stanfield a Unshrinkable Underwear will give you more comfort and longer wear than any underwear you could possibly buy here or elsewhere—that's why we self it. Come in and examine it for yourself.

A few bags used to hold all the mail that went north from EdI monton, but now one ton of matter leaves Athabasca every week on the Peace river route alone. Fifty sacks j of more, weighing about 100 pounds each, go out on the summer trip to the I end of the line. And the distributing j points are gradually shifting northward. Until a year or two ago all the north-bound mails were made up at Edmonton, but now they pass right ! through daily to Athabasca, where they are held till despatching time comes for the several routes north and northwest. Fort Smith, on the very top edge of Alberta, Is becoming a subsidiary distributing point, and the schedules now list the sub-| Arctic mails as leaving from Smith :

Nine round mail trips a year are made between Athabasca and Fort Smith, costing the Government In all $4,016. Two of these, one each in summer and winter, go on to McPherson, and others to nearer points, adding some $2,500 to the postal bill. Between Athabasca and Peace River Crossing there is a weekly mall, which costs $8,000 a year for delivery, and a twlce-a-week service between Edson and Grand Prairie goes at the rate of $300 a trip In winter and $275 In summer. Othor routes are prcled proportionately.
There is a good deal of romance about this northern mail service even In these days. The advent of the railroads, making the postal routes touch easier and cheaper, will do âway with some of this romance, but CANADA,’ a corporation legally con-in the top parts of the North coun- stituted, having its principal place of

ball—It would be a mighty projectile that would go through almost anything. It Is this danger which keeps the size and speed of flywheels down In practice, especially aboard ship.
It Is possible that projectiles will yet be made on this principle for certain purposes. Think what an army could do at short range If It was equipped with hundreds of big flywheels that could be released. They would travel along the ground at great speed and would simply mow down everything In their way. The only drawback to the use of flywheels In this way Is the resistance of the ground, and that would not hold for a distance as short as half i mils.
While in ordinary projectile hits In I him! having it* head office and chief one spot only, the flywheel would cover place of business in the city of Ottawa, an area as wide as the wheel and as | in the Provint* of Ontario ; Plaintiff,

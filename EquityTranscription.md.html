<p>&lt;p&gt; GLAD TIDINGS OF PEACE &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt; The majority of our citizens were aroused from their slumbers at five o’clock on Monday morning by the clarion tones of the Methodist Church bell. The first thought that filled some minds was that of fire, but the absence of the dreaded cry itself, at once dissipated all fear and the next thought was, can it be peace—Peace!—that word for which many millions of hearts so long have yearned! Communication with the Central Telephone office at once settled the point and then, as if by magic, the wonted still-ness of the early morning hour was broken, and the villagers ROSE to the stupendously important occasion. Salvos from fire-arms in all corners of the town followed each other in rapid succession, musical instruments gave a touch of harmony to the confusion of sounds, and even a fire and drum band was improvised to give tangible evidence of the fact that the townsfolk had suddenly got themselves into a celebrating mood. Anon the bell of St. Paul’s caught up the refrain of its big neighbor, while the whistles of the factories and mills, and even of adjacent threshing outfits joined in disseminating the glad tidings that the dawn of peace had at last come to a war-weary, blood deluged world! All day long the celebration in one form or another was continued. Workshops with few exceptions were closed; the blinds on the windows of all business places were drawn-in short it was a day off for everybody who could possibly avoid doing any real work, except that which preparation for the evening illumination entailed. The young men about town, released from their usual avocations, gave ample attention to that feature of the celebration. Every scrap of bunting that could be found was hauled out, and scarcely a house in town was lacking in its display of our national colors. The events of the day included – as it was only meet and right they should—expressions of thankfulness to the Omnipotent for the Supreme Part He has taken in fulfilling the aims and hopes of the Allies. These took the form of morning service at St. Paul’s at which Holly Communion was celebrated; also a union, open-air, afternoon service of special interest, in which Rev. A. T. Phillips, Anglican; Rev. W.B McCallum, Presbyterian; Rev. H. S. Cooke, Methodist, and Rev. H. A Watchjoin, S.C.  of A. took part. At this service Mr. Wm. Hodgins, M.L.A., presided. At 7 p.m. a thanksgiving service at St. Paul’s concluded the devotional features of a day’s proceedings long to be remembered in Shawville. But the end was not yet. The preparations already alluded to reached their culminating point when Mr. Silas Wilkie, the first Pontiac man who lost a son in the war, applied the torch to the huge pile of material that had been erected on the eminence north of the station, overlooking the town. The procession to this conspicuous point was led by four boys bearing on a stretcher a well inflated effigy of Kaiser Bill, and immediately following came the fife and drum artists, who rattled off “The British Grenadiers” and other popular airs, en route. When the immense heap of miscellaneous truck was well ablaze, shooting lurid tongues of flame toward the starry vault of heaven, the image of the deposed Hun ruler was projected into the foreground, and it too became fuel for the devouring element, while the air rang with the cheers from a thousand throats. Beyond this, there was no set program, and speech-making was decidedly tabooed; but a few of the local distinguished vocalists seized the occasion as opportune, to give vent to their feelings through repeated renditions of “The Maple Lead,” “When the Boys Come Home,” etc. This continued till the bonfire had spent its brilliancy, and the crowd, which foregathered from the dour corners of the surrounding district, began to disperse. It was a memorable night which all were eager to participate in, and one which all equally hope occasion will never require to be repeated. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt; A BIG SHIPMENT—What  was perhaps the largest shipment of livestock the ever went out of this country, was pulled out on Saturday afternoon by C. P. R. When  the train left Quyon it is said to have been made up of about 40 cars of Pontiac’s hoofed products,-- cattle, swine and sheep. The value of that trainload would be interesting information; but to follow the labyrinthine trail which leads to the procuring of the latter, is to arduous a task to undertake just now. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt; BIRTHS &lt;/p&gt;<br>
&lt;p&gt; At Shanghai, China, on August 25, 1918, to Rev. L. C. Whitelaw, B. A., and Mrs. Whitelaw, a daughter (Emma Claire.) &lt;/p&gt;</p>

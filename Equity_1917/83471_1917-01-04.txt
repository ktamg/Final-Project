It would be well for js Canadians if we learned something from the seriousness of Frenchmen. It never was true that France was a land of gayety and thoughtlessness more than others, but now what frivolity did exist has been suppressed.

Even pastry cooks must close, for their products are not considered as of prime necessity. The lighting and heating of Paris have been at all times expensive. There is no Niagara nearby to give cheap electricity, coal is dear and so gas comes high, and petroleum is costly. The old candle and the rape-oil lamp must now play their role as saviours of the people.

Did you ever notice when a man imites Lis thumb with a hammer while putting down a carpet under his wife's iupervislon how quickly he thrusts the bruised Lud throbbing member Into his mouth? People think It Is because the ippllcntlon Is soothing. But the movement Is purely Involuntarily, like wink-Tbe man cannot help It. The 'act Is that nature knows what a man s apt to say under such circumstances ind so has provided him with an automatic stopper. Whenever he hits his thumb hard enough to hurt—and it Joesn't take a very hard blow almost to kill a man when he Is doing something he doesn't like to do-by a sort jf Interlocking system his thumb flies into his mouth, and for the critical moment speech Is cut off.

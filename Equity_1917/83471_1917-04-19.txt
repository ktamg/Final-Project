During House Cleaning Time there is always more or less Painting to do-The question is what Paint to use.
.. We unhesitatingly recommend
Sherwin Williams
It costs just as much as a Good Paint ought to cost, not a cent more. If you pay more you pay too much. If you pay less you don’t get as good a Paint.
Best Paint is always most economical to use.
A PAINT FOR EVERY PURPOSE. Ask for Color Cards.

The Equity acknowledges the receipt of fifty cents from Mr.
W. J. Craig, of Creeinorne. Thorne, as a donation to the Soldier's Tobacco Fund. It is a pleasure to note that the appeal from the trendies for smokes, meets with a response from all sections of the country. There are a great many thousands of men at the front who look to their Canadian friends at home to keep them supplied with this little comfort, and all who are not prejudiced against the use of the “fragrant weed, ' should willingly contribute a small sum for that imnose.

“I am very pleased to see you watching the beautiful red glow of the setting sun, my little man,” he said, patting the youngster's back. “Do you watch It every night ?"

Wherever the Continental peoples wander they take their own country with them and reconstitute it, while the Briton invariably fits himself into native backgrounds. Thus you will find the true Paris in Soho; the real Russia in Stepney and Bethnal Green; the glamor of Italy in Clerkenwell; the spirit of Holland in Spitalfields; the mysterious Orient in Limehouse;
Norway, Sweden, and Denmark in Shadwell; Switzerland off Tottenham Court Road; the repellent atmosphere of Germany in Great Charlotte Street; and the Armenian Settlement is—well,

There is no reason why an attempt should be made to turn over the whole garden at once. A much better method is to first dig a plot sufficient for radishes, lettuce, cress, onions, etc.
This plot should be raked smooth, firmed and planted just as soon as it is ready. It will be ready for planting when the soil has become warmed up and not one minute before.
Garden seeds are too expensive this season to be wasted, but that is what will happen when the amateur fails to mix his commercial fertilizer with the soil in the furrows. If the seeds come into contact with the fertilizer, all their vitality will be burned out of them. This is a common error and explains why a great many seeds fail to sprout. The seedsman is not always to blame.	I

The common cabbage worm, the most destructive insect enemy of cabbage and related crops begins its depredations as soon as the young plants are set out in the spring. Steps to combat it should be taken at an equally early date. Spraying with a solution of two pounds of powdered arsenate of lead, four pounds of arsenate of lead in paste form, or one pound of Paris green to fifty gallons of water should be begun as soon as the plants are set out and should be repeated as often aa examination of the plants shows it to be necessary.

Beside the bed knelt Adrien Leroy, his face buried in one hand, the other resting upon the still one that lay, white as marble, on the silken coverlet.
He had come, overwhelmed with pain, from the scene on the terrace, to pour forth a passionate grief and remorse over this young life that had been so generously given up to save his.
It mattered nothing to him that the dead girl was the daughter.of the man whom he had befriended, and who had used his generosity only as a means by which to betray him; it mattered nothing that his grief might even now be misconstrued by the tongues of the uncharitable. He knelt in the deepest humility by the dead girl’s side, deeming his life all unworthy to have been saved at such a cost; and while he implored the pardon of the great Creator for the fr'lies of his past lift he celled on the Almighty to hear the vows which he now made- that for the future hi* steps would be in wiser paths.

the purpose of so reducing shipping as to more than counterbalance her own losses, during the war, and so to leave her mercantile fleet proportionately stronger than any other carrying fleet at the termination of hostilities
may be pointed out that, as the Dutch have insisted, the ships of the smaller neutral nations have been sunk indiscriminately.

The present war, however, Mr. Henderson clearly sees as an incident, colossal as it is, in the world’s history. Like Sir Edward Grey, he realises that if advantage cannot be taken of the present struggle, to prevent future struggles, nothing but a positively disastrous incident will be added to the experience of humanity. For this reason he welcomes warmly the proposal of a league to Insure peace, in the days beyond the If this can be wrought out, he foresees a period when treaties amongst nations will take the place of statute law, and the moral and unwritten demands of Principle become the common law of mankind. The recent exchange of notes between President Wilson and the Foreign Office, in London, bave resulted, be insists, In something more than a mere succès d’estime ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ course, they have not had, and could scarcely be expected to have an im mediate and a direct result, they have, in bis opinion, been distinctly Indirectly beneficial, especially In gard to the fact that they have enabled the Allies to make clear their Intention, that the peace shall only leave a condition of things which will prove to the most hardened disregarder of international law that such contempt can In no way prove profitable.

Wood and Water.
The destruction which the war has wrought in British forests has caused many an artist to shed unpatriotic tears. Yet the csarring of beauty spots is merely one objection to treefelling on a large scale.
The rains which refresh the earth, and which are essential to its productivity, are largely influenced by the effect of forests on the upper atmosphere, and—to carry the danger of tree-felling to its fantastic limit—if every tree in the world were felled the earth would indeed be a parched planet!	\
Many ideas have been held in regard to rain, and many experiments worked out. People used to ring church bells during dry seasons, hoping the concussion would bring rain. The effect of gunfire upon weather is still a debated point. Not long ago the wine-growers of Italy and Austria feared for their crops, and induced their Governments to try “weather shooting” on a big scale. The results were unsatisfactory, though they did not shake everybody’s belief in gunfire as a rain producer,

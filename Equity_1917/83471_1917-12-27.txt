GETTING WAR
PHOTOGRAPHS
As you look over the photographs telling pkiortally the story of the war do you ever give a thought to the man behind the camera, the photographer who by making him life made your entertainment possible? In the wars of old most of the pictures were taken after battle* were fought. To-day the modern camera shows the enemy charging across No Man’s Land, i swooping airplane dealing out death to those fighting below; U-boats torpedoing steamships and warships sinking with hundreds of dead and survivors in the nearby waters. Movies show bursting shells, trench life and men going over the top.

‘ Nobody can tell just what price hogs will command next fall, but this much is certain—people will eat pork if they can get it. So, go ahead and breed for spring pigs.
When the pigs begin to show signs of weak legs, you may know that you have not given them the chance they need to walk around and exercise. Hogs running in a pasture rarely get weak in the hind quarters.
; Cooking feed for swine is not ad I visable, because it lowers its digestibility. This means that the swine will require more food to produce the same amount of gain in weight. The cooking raises the expense of produc tion and ruts down the profits.
Potatoes, field peas, and roots, used as food in some localities, re more palatable and have their water content lowered when rooked. This also makes it necessary for the swine to consume more feed.
Cooking feeds requires a special ap para turn, and takes much time and labor All of these things Id to the expense of production.

MURRAY BROS., SHAWVILLE.
Referring to the rec ent vote in North Renfrew, (where t’ul. Mackie was elected by a majority of IW over Norman Reid), the Pembroke Standard says
“That the Laurier platform appealed to the Germans of this constituency is shown by the fact that in one polling sitb-division Mackie got 3 and Reid 1*2 German votes; in another Mackie 0 and Reid 115 ; and another Mackie 8, Reid 71.
They certainly were against Union Government and the carrying on of war measures.
The same thing happened in Kitchener, Ont., where the Unionist was turned down by the almost solid German vote ; and, lest we should forge t, there was out own Ladysmith, which in the past under normal conditions, has in

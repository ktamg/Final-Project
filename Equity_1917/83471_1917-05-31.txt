At present the United States is the grand almoner and cannot afford to aet the prices for itself and leave its associates to bargain for themselves. For all this the people as a whole will be truly grateful and thankful, for they would much prefer to trust themselves to a paternalistic government than to the greed and avarice of individuals and corporate monopolies, whose lust for gain is not penetrated by a single ray of pity.
We know what they are doing in central Europe, and why the enemy

think of the time the Ford saves a busy farmer in hauling milk to the cheese factory—vegetables, butter, eggs and poultry to market—fruit to the railway station. One fruit grower, last season, made four trips a day to the railway station, a total of 144 miles, and carried as high as 7'1 crates of 11 quarts each on a trip. Hu couldn’t have made more than one 3<> mile trip a day with a team.
The Ford soon pays for itself in the time it saves the farmer. With help so scarce, every farmer needs to make use of every preci-cious minute of his time. To him the Ford car is a real necessity. Indeed, some farmers tell us that it is doubtful if they could carry their farm work under present labor conditions if it wasn’t for the time the Ford saves them.
No further need to be without a Ford. In fact the average farmer could afford one if it were double the price. It is as easy to drive as a horse, three times as fast, and costs less per- mile to run. Why not order one today ?

FIGHTING GRAIN DISEASES.
SHAWVILLE MOTOR COMPANY Registered.
Knomioii* Losses ( au>nl to This
Country by Uu*t.
In a recent address, the Dominion Minister of Agriculture, Hon. Mar- , tin Burrell, stated that last year’s &C epidemic of rust In the Prairie provinces had cost this country $1,000,000. That represents $143 for every farmer in Canada. Other diseases and drought occasioned the country a loss of another $50,000,000. No specific remedy for rust has yet been discovered. This much Is known, that a late maturing crop is more subject to the disease than one that ripens early. It therefore fol- , lows that while no variety of grain
C AMPBELLS BAY, QUE. is immune, the early maturing va- |
V.l ^	^	rietiee will have the best chance of
escaping. A reasonably early Spring, early sowing, and a quick-maturing variety of grain constitutes the best Insurance against such an outbreak as was experienced last year.
Among other diseases which cause havoc among growing grains, smut Is perhaps the most widespread. It Is stated that the annual loss due to smut In oats, wheat, and barley amounts, In an ordinary year, to $17,000,000, or 6.2 per cent, of the capital invested in those crops. This enormous loss Is almost entirely preventable by treating the seed before sowing In a solution made from one
DOMINION 4 PROVINCIAL LAND SURVEYOR pound formalin to 35 gallons of
water. Prevention of this kind is most necessary in these days of high coat of labor and seed. Wherever
there is a danger of smut attacking |„on of the gardens and woods at either of these crops, farmers will do Kew, England, all the brown British well to take this simple precaution, squirrels have disappeared. Whe-Stem rust of grain occurs on ther the two have Interbred is not

Jeweiery is the thing to give for a Wedding Present because it expresses the sentiment of the giver.
Who does not treasure a King, a Pin, a Brooch, a Necklace, a Watch or Silverware, which was received as a gift at a certain time, especially if it be Wedding Time ?
Therefore the Jeweiery you give the bride or to a friend should have the “ quality there.” We sell Quality Jeweiery, modern in style, reasonable in price.

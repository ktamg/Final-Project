I Women in trousers have long f ed to be a novelty here. Three years ago this one would have blocked traffic in the Strand. To-day she is simply a woman “doing her bit” in a great army of women workers mobilized “to keep the home fires burning.”
The war found British men unprepared and confused, but unafraid. It found women almost entirely ignored,
I though their patriotism ran just as I high as that of their brothers, fathers and sons. After three years of strife there are still no quitters among the women, and few pacifists or “conscientious objectors.”
In the first days every woman wanted to be a nurse. It made difference that she probably had never even bandaged a frostbitten [ „ toe or extracted a splinter from her finger, She declared she was fully qualified to nurse the wounded Tommies who were coming home in hundreds in those confused days.
I The romance of nursing appealed to the lady in Belgravia, the cotton spinner in Manchester, and the typist in Whitehall.

Only those who have been there realize what the Gillette Safety Razor is doing for the wounded !
Clean shaving on the firing line, possible only with a Gillette, has saved endless trouble in dressing face wounds. In the hands of orderly or nurse it shortens by precious minutes the preparations for

get the Gillette into action, and fairly revel in the
finishing touch which it gives to the welcome clean.

Pat was a witty young recruit, who was taking instruction in marksman-| The squad had finished firing. Pat was brought to task for his poor sjtooting, and told that he must do belter at the next distance; there were to be seven rounds of quick firing. “Now, Pat,” the sergeant told him, fire at target No. 5.”
Pat banged away, and hit target No. 4 seven times In succession.
What target did you aim at?” asked the irate officer.
“No. 6, sor,” answered Pat.
“And you have hit

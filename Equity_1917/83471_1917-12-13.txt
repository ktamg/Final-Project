If the Allies were beaten. Canada might be seized by Germany even without being attacked or conquered. “ Gott Strafe England ” is the slogan in which Germany has expressed its ferocious hatred for England. Should Germany be victorious, she would certainly impose the most drastic conditions possible on England
and would strip the Empire of its brightest jewel.
Nor would the Monroe Doctrine save us, because this doctrine would not survive a defeat of the Allies.
Do Canadians wish to pass under German domination ? Are they tired of the democratic regime, and are they anxious to put their necks and the necks of their children under the yoke of Prussian despots ?

Should England, France and the United States be defeated, they would still preserve their independence and would probably regain their power in time.

It will be found In most cases that the use of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills to build up the blood will atop the sensation of pain in the ill-nourished muscles of the back. How much better it Is to try Dr. Will lams' Pink Pills for the blood than to give way to unreasonable alarm about your kidneys. If you suspect your Kidneys any doctor can make tests In ten minutes that will set fears at rest, of tell you the

life
So I am asking you for aid, for the open purse of the Hospital's friend is the hope of the Hospital at Christmas, Just as the open door of the Hospital's mercy is the hope of the little children
throughout the year.
Calls on generous hearts are many in these times. Calls on the Hospital are many at all times, and especially when food and fuel and drugs and service costs are soaring high. YOU know the high cost of living. Do you know the high cost of healing—of helping the helpless to happiness? What you do to assist Is the best investment you will ever make.
Do you realise what this charity Is doing for sick children, not only of Toronto, but for all Ontario, for out of h a total of 3,740 In-patients last year 11 646 came from 254 places outside of 0 Toronto. The field of the Hospital's — | service covers the entire Province— from the Ottawa to the far-off Honors —from the borders of the Great Lakes to the farthest northerly district.
The Hospital Is doing a marvellous work. If you could see the children with crippled limbs, club feet, and •ther deformities, who have left the Hospital with straightened limbs and •erfect correction, your response to our appeal would be Instant Orthopedic Departments last year • total of 330 in-patients were treated; and In the Out Patient Department there were 1,946 attendances.
Let your money snd the Hospital’s mercy lift the burden of misery that curses the lives, cripples the limbs and saddens the mothers of the suffering little children Money mobilises the powers of help and healing for the Hospital's drive day sad night against the trench where disease and pain and death assail the lives of the little ones.
Remember that every dollar given to the Hospital Is a dollar subscribed to the Liberty Loan that opens the prisons of pain and the Bastilles of disease, and sets little children free to breathe the pure air, and to rejoio# In the mercy of God's sunlight.

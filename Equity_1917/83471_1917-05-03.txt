Give Yourself the Joy of Seeing the "Green Things Grow ."
Farming is man's most natural, moat honorable calling.
Man was born in a garden.
Just where this garden was, the theologians and the archaeologists and the other science mongers are not yet fully agreed. But of one thing we are certain—it was out of doors!
And the "Golden Age" of the old Greeks and Romans—that also was an out-of-doors' experience—a life close to Nature.
In that happy age every man sowed and tilled and reaped.
Every man earned his bread by the sweat of his brow. And the exercise and the sweat kept his blood clean.
If all men and women were farmers to-day, nine-tenths of the doctors would have to go out of business.
The average farmer lives fifteen years longer than the average city dweller.
The reason is obvious. The farmer lives in the light and the air—pure air.
City dwellers—the doctors, the lawyers, the professors, the clerks, the stenographers, the factory workers— live in the shade and breathe dust

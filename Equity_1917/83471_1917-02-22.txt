I State or Church crowns a Prussian j king. He crowns himself. Curiously enough, the Kaiser never crowned himself as King of Prussia, and it is said that the reason he omitted thic ceremony was because it would call attention to the.fart that he was King of Prussia alone, and could not be crowned Emperor of Germany. The title, indeed, is an honorary one, though the Kaiser would give much if it were a reality.

To polish the peanuts and to remove the earth and stems the nuts are scoured in large metal cylinders, from which they pass through blast fans, in which a strong current of air separates the fully developed nuts having sound kernels from those imperfectly filled and from empty pods. The sound nuts fall through the fan upon sorting tables, where those that are discolored are taken out and the bright ones are passed on into sacks that will each hold about 100 pounds of nuts. Each sack to marked with the brand that indicates the grade of Its contents.

one of its liabilities—It really was an asset—a contract to pay Charles M. Schwab that unheard of sum annually.
J. P. Morgan didn’t know what to do about IL Tho highest salary on record was $100,0U0. He was In a quandary.
Finally he summoned Schwab, showed him the contract and hesitatingly isked wbat could be done about It.
“This,'' said Schwab.
lie tore it up.
That contract had netted Schwab $1,300,000 the previous year.
"Î didn’t core what salary they paid me. I was not animated by money motives, l believed in what 1 was trying to do, and 1 wanted to see it brought about I canceled that contract without a moment's hesitation.” Thus did Mr. Schwab explain bis action to me.
There was n sequel. Morgan later told Carnegie how magnanimously Schwab had acted. Carnegie remarked, "Charlie Is tho only man ! know who would have done that"
And lie promptly sent Schwab In bonds the full amount of tho contract
Carnegie declared publicly. "1 0W9 my fortune chiefly to two men. Bill Jones and Charlie Schwab."
Schwab, let me add, for years picked âli thfi Carnegie partners. Corey was J a laborer when the eagle eyed Schwab first spotted and promoted him. The only man to whom the canny Scot ever gave carte blanche was Schwab.—B. C. Forbes In Leslie's Weekly.

In death we do the same.

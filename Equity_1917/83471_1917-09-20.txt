One dollar deposited In a savings bank that i>ays 4 i>er cent will amount to $2.19 in twenty years. This Is simple compound interest. Now, if you deposit $1 every year for twenty years, or $20 In all, the sum to your credit will have grown to $30.07.
Any wage earner can put by $1 a week. That money deposited In a savings hank for twenty years will have Inc rented to $1,012.

A Republic of Seventy
The smallest republican State in regard to population is Tavolara, a little-known island about five miles long with an average width of half a mile, situated off the north coast of Sardinia. Many maps and geography books totally ignore the existence of this State. Yet it is a free and independent republic of about 70 inhabitants, who are their own rulers.
The people of Tavolara declared their independence as recently as 1880, the island having previously been made over in 1836 by King Charles Albert of Sardinia to the Bartoleoni family. None of the Great Powers objected when the island threw off the yoke of monarchy, and during the last 17 years the inhabitants have lived in pence with the world. ë"They elect a President every six years, and a council of six members, all of whom serve the State without gpyment. !

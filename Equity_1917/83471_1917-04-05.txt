Enquiry at the h*»ad office of the Imperial Oil Co. to-day did not bear out the theory that Germany could not sink new wells in the Roumanian oil fields in less than three years. Reports of destruction are so complete as to make It certain that Germany cannot get oil without sinking new wells fields oppose a hard formation to the drills and the authorities of the Imperial Oil Co. state that six months is a minimum time for drilling s shallow well in Roumania and eighteen months a minimum time for the deeper wells. British engineers and Canadian oil drillers seem to have combined to disappoint Ger many's hopes of securing an Immediate supply of oil from the Roumanian wells.

Buy seeds early this year. According to all estimates there will be thousands tilling the soil who never touched it before. This means an immense amount of extra seed will have to be provided. The wise farmer or gardner will purchase McDonald's Tested Seeds earlier than usual. A few reliable and very prolific specialties for home gardening are:—
F a regiment of soldiers were to march through the streets of one of our cities in a uniform of checker-hoard pattern, arranged in squares of bright red, green, and yellow, it would create, to say the least, a popular sensation.

One of the oddest of the new departures of the present war is the utilization of optical illusions for cheating the ever-watchful eyes of the enemy, and in this line the most curious expedient is that of painting things out of sight ample, an effort is made to render the big guns invisible by scattering daubs of the primary colors over the weapons and their carriages war departments have been making i xperiments of the same kind, the great guns and their concrete emplacements as well being painted red, yellow, green, and blue. It is lound that by this means they are rendered much less distinct as targets. The guns and gun carriages of the field artillery have likewise been experimentally painted in stripes of
green, yellow, and red
chromatically adorned found to be actually invisible at a distance of only 1,000 yards.

Such a method, however, is very It crude. It represents only a first at ^^Bptin the development of a new
d later on to be applied in a scientific way, in accordance with iertao. well-known principles of optics. The daubs of paint confuse the eye, but if the colors were properly employed they would liake the guns actually invisible.
Daylight, of course, is made up of ail the colors of the rainbow mixed together. In otter words, the colors properly mingled make no color. It follows that a run and its carriage correctly painted would have no visibility at all at any considerable distance. Neither, lor that matter, would an airpiar.» flying overhead.
We may have before long invisible machines.
Warplanes am! military balloons
nowadays are painted light gray, to I ,dcmvhoro harmonize with the sky and render |tlb them less visible, llut a gray object in the sky can be seen; if of no color It cannot be seen, because daylight is of no color.
The only problem is so to arrange the colors that, optically, they shall mingle. This cannot be properly accomplished by a mere scattering of daubs of paint. The thing has to be done on scientific principles. Whether It would be better to adopt for the purpose a checkerboard pattern or a series of horizontal, vertical, or wavy parallel narrow stripes remains to be determined by experiment.
Probably any of these arrangements would serve the purpose. The result would be a chromatic scheme corresponding in effect to a rainbow.
The colors of a rainbow mixed together make no color. So, in like manner, the colors applied with paint in the manner described would so mingle to the eye of an observer at a moderate distance that the object (gun, airplane or what not) would be invisible.
One naturally asks:	How might
this idea be utilized to lend invisibility to ships? The sea is blue. The sea is green. The sea is of varying tints, according to the color of the sky, which it reflects with its own modifications. Hut, generally speak- tyfg ing, the color of the sea is a mixture i of violet and green; and It is urged by one theorist on the subject that ships could be made at least relative- , ly invisible by painting them with a checkerboard or other pattern of these two colors.
Warships nowadays, to render them as little conspicuous as possible, are painted gray; so, likewise, are guns and military automobiles.
The German soldier is uniformed in ' mist-gray." Hut gray means obscurity, not invisibility. To obtain the latter the armies and navies of the future may have to resort to the most brilliant color patterns for the

is bought and sent to the wounded Tommy.
The authorized nurse visits him once a week. On the first visit she gets such particulars as name, number, battalion, when wounded, nature of wound when admitted to hospital, and next-of-kin and their address.
These particulars are all put on a I card and tiled. The relatives are f then communicated with and all particulars given. Once a week a letter goee to the next-of-kin telling of the ¦t progress of the patient.
«• When he is sent to a Convalescent > Home he is then considered able to i, do this work himself. Miss Clara I Hagarty, of Toronto, the well known artist, is in charge of the parcel room, having been there from the start, and never missed a day. The parcels are made up individually and sent collectively to the hospitals. f The largest number of parcels ever sent out in one day was 496. i Another interesting department is I in- the paper section, where all the forthc newspapers are received. A soldier may ask for a Hamilton paper, and if unobtainable a Toronto one is sent him, or be may be from Calgary, and get a Winnipeg paper. Countess Fe-rozine, formerly Miss Molson, of Montreal, is in charge of this work.
Taking the patients out for motor rides is another very well organized work. Large cards are hung in the hospitals telling that if anyone wants a motor ride to communicate with the Red Cross. There are four special cars ready to take them for a run into the country for tea or possibly just to the theatre. A large Red Cross is painted on the windshield. Sir Arthur Law ley supplies a car and chauffeur. Mr. W. H. Caw-thra another, which he drives himself. Delightful hospitality Is offered the boys by thaï raing English hostesses, eager to shower kindness on the brave Canadians. Mrs. Rivers Bulkley is in charge of the prisoner of war parcels and everything is working smoothly now.
Some idea of the work that many of Canada’s smart society girls are doing in London was given when Mrs. Cawtbra told of the Maple Leaf Clubs and what they mean to our boys. Lady Drummond Is bead of this work also, and there are seven of them running, with a possibility of the need for more. Miss Macdonald, daughter of Dr. A A Macdonald, is In charge of three In Connaught Place and baa eight others associated with her.

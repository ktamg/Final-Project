It was raining and a chilly wind blew as we passed beneath a battered arch into the tragic desolation of
Arras.	f
I have seen villages pounded by
gunfire into hideous mounds of dust and rubble, their very semblance blasted utterly away; but Arras, shell torn, scarred, disfigured for all time, Is a city still—a City of Desolation Her streets lie empty and silent, her pleasant squares are a dreary desolation, her noble buildings, manu-ments of hér ancient splendor, are ruined beyond repair. Arras Is a dead city, whose mournful silence is broken only by the intermittent thunder of
guns.	n
Thus, as I 'paced these deserted streets, where none moved, save myself (for my companions had hastened on), as I gated on ruined buildings that echoed mournfully to my tread, what wonder that my thoughts were gloomy as the day itself! 1 paused in a street of fair, tall houses, from whose broken windows curtains of lace, of plush and tapestry flapped mournfully In the chill November wind like rags upon a corpse, while from some dim interior came the hollow rattle of a door, while In every gust a swinging shutter groaned despairingly on rusty hinge.

Through all these gloomy relics of a vanished people 1 went slow-footed and heedless of direction until by chance I came out into the wide Place and saw before me all that remained of that stately building which for centuries had been the Hotel de Ville, the City Hall, now nothing but a crumbling ruin of noble arch and massive tower; even so, In shattered facade and mullioned windows one might yet see something of that beauty which had made it famous.
Oblivious of driving rain I stood bethinking me of this ancient city; how In the dark ages it had endured the horrors of battle and siege, had fronted Yhe catapaults of Rohie, heard the fierce shouts of barbarian assailants, known the merciless savagery of religious wars and remained a city ytill only for the cultured barbarian of to-day to make It a desolation.

WINTER WHEAT POINTERS
Ontario farmers at this time are busy with their preparation of the winter wheat areas. They are taking special care to give the ground the very best preparation, since winter wheat this year means money. Prices are high and there seems every Indication that they will remain so. In fact, wheat prices have but a very few times surpassed that obtained at the present time. The United States has Just harvested a moderately large crop and the government Is calling for an increase of over 30% of the crop produced in 1917. over a billion bushels of wheat this coming year.

Even though the hog furnishes the most meat for a given amount of feed and will produce it in the quickest time, it is pointed out that this meat should be produced mainly from food wastes and not from good grain that would furnish food directly to man. The great economy in pork production comes from the fact that pigs furnish a food by-product from these wastes and do not need the high-grade feeds that beef cattle must have.
Wastes on farms and in the towns make good hog feed; by-products from canneries, bakeries, fisheries, packing plants r.nd the like can be utilized as hog feed and to better economic advantage than in any other way. Dairy wastes are particularly valuable as hog feed and promote rapid growth

HELPED WITH CANTEEN.
Canadian Woman Became Popular
W'lth Londoners.
She was a Canadian who had no desire to make her stay In England a burden to the country. So she tackled the largest canteen In London and set about switching her training In dollars and cents to grasp shillings and pence. And, being Canadian, she quickly picked it up. Also, being Canadian and thus unsaddled with the rules and regulations, the constitution and by-laws, of class, she made many friends among the
munitioners.
They were a kindly lot, those munitioners, many of them old men and | »« Money Saved many very young for factory life.

During its migration in October the chickadee is more numerous in the New England states than in the summer. Throughout the greater part of Its range, from Labrador to Marymrvl and In the Alleghenies southward to North Carolina, these merry midgets are found at all seasons. But it is with the fall and winter that they are generally associated. No one need feel lonely when these little black and white birds are around. They are so friendly and tame and some of their notea sound so much like words that they seem to be talking. Besides the familiar "chick a-dee ” call they bare a high, sweet whistle of two or three
notes.	.	^	.
In the autumn the partridge berries
are ripe, and upon them these birds, bare many a feast. And later the berries of the wlntergreen, Solomon's seal, dogwood and Indian encumber be used as food.

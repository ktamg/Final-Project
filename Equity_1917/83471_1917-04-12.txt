M. Albert Thomas is taking on powers which were, before the reorganization, entirely in the hands of the commander-in-chief lie will use them subject to the tinal sanction of the Minister of War. Though, of course, the new balance of power has shorn the commander-in-chief of some of his privileges, he yet remains the entire master of th* strategy on his particular front. In that respect General Nivelle will have exactly the same opportunities as General Joffre, and the record of General Lyautey in Morocco proves him to he perfectly capable of exercising undisputed authority as responsible head, whit* allowing perfect independence in tactical matters to the men whose part it Is to load the armies In the field.

There is little need to say much about Admiral Jellicoe. He command* ed the fleet which secured the safe transport of seven millions by sea.
General Sir William Robertson, Chief of the Imperial Stuff, has risen from the lowest rank in the British Army to the high position he now holds.
The public knows much of the careers of the Seven Men who Matter,

On their wisdom depends the very food we oat. Without the forces marshalled by these seven men the work of our gallant and powerful Allies would be in vain, and the British Empire would go down in ruins.

Free Milk Record Forms.
Two five-year-old cows in a dairy herd jvhere cow testing ia practiced made two widely divergent records in 1916. One gave 6,616 pounds of milk and 204 pounds of fat, the other gave 8,870 pounds of milk and 288 pounds of fat. This means twenty-seven dollars difference In Income between the two. The owner did not expect to find such a difference. Yet who but the man among his cows all the time should best know their possibilities ? Is there as much difference as that between two cows in your herd? Cow testing will help you to know, and will help you to save time, labor and feed. For if you retain only the best cows, you keep those that you are sure will repay you handsomely for all you expend on them. A request to the Dairy Commissioner, Ottawa, for milk record forms should state whether you want those for daily or three days weights per month; they are free for asking.

Gaea is the natural outpost across the desert from Egypt.
The Bedouin from a hundred miles away come into the bazaars for their cloth, weapons and pottery. The inhabitants were characterized as ‘lovers of pilgrims,' whom, no doubt, like the \ Damascenes, they found profitable. As from Damascus, so from Gaza, great trade routes travelled in all directions —to Egypt, to South Arabia, and, in times of the Nabatean Kingdom, to Petra and Palmyra.

Modest Blackmons.
That the author of "Lorna Doone” was one of the best fruit growers In England is brought out by Hildegarde Hawthorne in an article on Blackmore which she contribute* to St. Nicholas. Indeed, it was of his fruit that he loved most to talk, according to Miss Hawthorne. Of his writings or of himself at all It was very difficult to get him to say a word, for he was shy and modest to a high degree. If you tried to make him talk about bis books he would always slip quickly away to something about peaches or nectarines or plums, or be would ask you to come out to sec his garden and wander there happily, pruning shears In hand, pointing out Ids prize fruits and telling you Just what must be done to bring each type to perfection.

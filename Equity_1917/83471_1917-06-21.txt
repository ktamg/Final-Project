A farm hand who had worked hard in the fields for dawn until darkness day after day, and had been obliged to finish his chorea by lantern light, went to the farmer at the end of the month and said:
"I'm going to quit. You promised me a steady Job of work."
“Well, haven’t you got one?" was the astonished reply.
“No," said the man, "there are three or four hours every night when I don't have anything to do except to fool my time away sleeping."

to drink or to add nourishment to cereals, soups, sauces and other foods. If you do not want milk to sour, keep it cool, clean and covered continually. Remember, too, that sour milk, buttermilk and sour cream are valuable in cookery, so do not "waste any. Sour milk and buttermilk can be used with soda in making hot breads, or sour milk can be turned easily into cottage cheese, cream cheese or clabber. Sour cream is a good shortening in making cakes and cookies and useful for salad dressings and gravies for meat.

The settee, which was a link between the settle and the sofa, was iometlmes used as a bed. This piece )f furniture was both of Imported and lomestic make. The back and seat were usually Incased In turnkey work. With the exception of the arms and braces the entire frame was concealed.
The construction of the colonial settee was identical with one type of the renaissance seat From Italy it pass'd Into France and from France to England. Holland had no part In its levelopment
From the Italian palace of the sixteenth century to the New England borne of the seventeenth was a far-iway cry, and yet, barring cjude work-nans hip, the colonial bench was a 'althful copy of the renaissance de-slgn.

THE OLD HURDY GURDY.
DR. A. H. BEERS
Pontiac’s Only Newspaper.
Crude Musical Instrument That Led Up to the Hand Organ.
The early type of hard y gurdy orlg-nated in (fermany during the ninth century and under the name of tauren eyer (peasant's lyre) attained great popularity throughout Europe, falling nto a decline only at the beginning of be last century. Even today a slight-y modernized type of this Instrument nay be seen upon the streets of the I smaller towns of Savoy.
The instrument consisted of a violin-ike frame and sounding board, provid-3d with from three to six strings. The music was produced by a small crank Actuated wooden wheel, whose resined ?dge boro against the strings. The two outer strings were keyed In uni-wn and when the wheel was revolved gave forth a bass note which served as i musical background. The remaining it rings were attached to keys, by which :heir tension and their tone might be raried. This adjustment was the only 'ontrol possessed by the player.
Needless to say, the hurdy gurdy was wlted only to the most elementary of «elections. While originally much used it fetes aud celebrations, it later was used only by Itinerant street musicians, a position now occupied by its successor—the hand organ

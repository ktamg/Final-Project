How To Get Hot Spark For Engine
“A good hot spark decides the difference between a good motor and a poor one/' says an experkflHHB|fl a motor has been condemned because of sluggish action, weak power, lack of flexibility and other faults, and the reason laid to faulty design, whereas the trpuble was due to a weak spark and the owner did not know it.
“The reason for this is obvious. If the spark is not hot enough the explosion loses a great deal of its snappiness and the power suffers in consequence. Other things being equal, the power depends dijrsctly upon the heat of the spark. Thé hotter the spark the stronger the explosion. The other factors referred to are carbure-tion, lubrication, compression and cooling, these five factors being necessary for the engine to run and develop full power.
“Now it must be explained why a hot spark gives a snappy explosion. If you wish to burn a large mass of rubbish quickly you would set fire to it in several places at once set the fire at only one spot it will burn in all probability, but it will take longer and it might go out. By igniting the pile in several places the whole will be consumed in less time and if the fire goes out in one or two places the other flames will do the work.

The Real “War
Bread ” must contain the entire wheat grain—not the white flour center every particle of gluten and mineral salts—also the outer bran coat that is so useful in keeping the bowels healthy and active. Shredded Wheat Biscuit is the real “war bread” because it is 100 per cent, whole wheat prepared in a digestible form. Contains no yeast, baking powder, seasoning, or chemicals of any kind. Food conservation begins with Shredded Wheat Biscuit for breakfast and ends with Shredded Wheat Biscuit for supper. Delicious with sliced bananas, berries, or other fruits.

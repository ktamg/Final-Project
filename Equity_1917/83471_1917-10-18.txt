beef in storage Is capital on which we can draw for supplying our friends in need overseas."
On the inside front page of the book an explanation Is given of why the Canadian housewives should economize with their Hour article says:
“It is now calculated that Great Britain, France, and other Kuropean allies and men at the front will require 971 million bushels of wheat.
Great Britain and the allied Kuropean countries can provide but 34 9 million bushels, leaving 677 million bushels to be supplied by Import.
The normal consumption of Canada and the United States, the only countries readily available in the present food crisis, would permit the export this year of not more than 207 millions, according to the latest crop reports. That means a shortage of 370 millions for Great Britain and her Allies, and a shortage for the soldiers in the Held.
“If the 370 millions shortage had to be provided entirely by Canada and the United States, Canada’s proportion would be 25,900,000 bushels, or one-half the normal consumption.
Canadians must make up as large a proportion as possible of their share by substituting other foods, or the German starvation campaign will succeed.
The morning meeting opened with the submitting of the renort by the county secretary treasurer, Mias Frances Bryson. The report showed tlie Asso-iation to Ik* in a satisfactory condition financially. Therenortaof the district representatives which followed were very complete. While in most places most encouraging work had lieen accomplished, the need of renewed effort, especially in some localities, was clearly shown.
These re^iorta were followed by a discussion on the Intermediate department. In this, the need of lenders, and also the co-operation between teachers and minister was dwelt upon.
The speaker of the morning, Mrs. Burgess, of Ottawa, was then introduced. This lady, who is a recognised authority on Sunday School work, gave a two hours'talk on “The ( ! radix! Sys-This system, by which each pu-

A discussion on the (traded System
followed the address.
In the afternoon, Mr. W. A. llodging of Shaw'ille, opened an interesting dis mission on the Senior department. The Seniors time was thought to be the time of concentration, the time of greatest energy, the time when the reasoning powers were most 'developed ; consequently the Sunday School should not do everything for the pupils of this stage, but instead must give them a chance to think and do for themselves.
The pui |H>sc and results of the Cradle Boll were then fully dwelt tipm by Mrs.
Burgess, after which the latter ga\e an especially impressive demonstration on teaching a beginner's class, illustrating the tour steps preparation, setting off, the impression on the pupil and the vx-pression of the pupil.
The committee then submitted their rejHirts including the appointment of officers for the coming year. Rev. F.
W. K. Harris was ap|MÛuted president, and Miss F. O. Bryson re ap|santed sec.-ireusurer.
In the evening Mr. .1.1. Brown Montreal gave an address on the Home I depart ment, emphasizing the need of

Here is a story of heroism and resourcefulness that is not often e i
field artillery was under a concentrated fire from enemy guns. Gunner William MacLean was In an old German gun pit during the bombardment when a direct hit caused twelve casualties
and hand MacLean turned at once to the duty of rescuing those who were In worse case than himself. One of the victims was pinned down beneath heavy debris and there was a danger that If left in the position In which he was he could not survive

not reach the spot because of the needs of other wounded, was consulted and he advised amputation of the shattered leg so that the victim might be released nerve, In the smoke-filled gun pit, MacLean performed the amputation, thus showing what the official report records as a splendid example of bravery, determination, and devotion to duty, for which the military medal has been awarded.

Honey Crop Lew* This Year.
Last year the bees of Ontario apparently had a banner year, but it cannot be said pf them this year. According to the Department of Agriculture the honey crop will be from joe-third to one-half of what it was ast year, though the yield will be iround what It was for the preceding wo or three years.
Last year the honey crop was 90 pounds per colony, while this year .he best that an be expected is 51.6 1er colony. In Ontario there are be-ween 125,000 and 150,000 colonies >f bees producing honey, or in other words the honey crop this year will ie between 6,375,000 and 7,850,000 pounds.
The reason given for the drop over ast year's yield Is that tho season was wet during clover time, and the lackwardness of the season gener-illy. The western section of Ontario s more affected than the eastern
portion
nIles from Toronto, who had 22,000 >ounds of honey last year, has only >,000 this year.
The Ontario Beekeepers’ Assocla-.lon report from 500 members bears >ut the statement from the Department <>f Agriculture, ion reports that the market has been >are of honey, and owing to the increase in the necessaries of life, it is expected the price of honey will be ncreased slightly.
The prices recommended are: Best iuality light extracted, wholesale, 14 .o 16 cents a pound; retail, 17% to |0 cents a pound; best quality comb, wholesale, comb, wholesale, $2 to $2.50 a dozen. These prices are being paid at the present time in Ontario and In the United States, where prices have advanced, the surplus honey from the western States going direct to Europe for the use of the armies of the Allies.

A “Thrift** Rhyme.
The National Food Commission of the United States, like Silas Wegg, has “dropped into poetry,” to express Its sense of the need for the preservation of food, and its effort has produced the following;
From our constant daily reading we can see the thing we’re needing is the stuff for fully feeding folks
at home and folks alü*HIIIIIIIII!|llll||llllllllllllllll
Uily papers tell us facts and figures that compel us to be wide-awake and jealous of the waste we should debar. Bread and butter, beans and berries, kraut and cabbage, cheese and cherries, and the eggs of Tom and Jerries should be saved throughout the land, so that ours, the fruitful nation, may prevent the quick starvation of the Balance of creation in the troublous Limes at hand. Though it seems inconsequential, each small slice of bread’s essential to keep famine pestilential from ourselves and our lilies; waste of food is unpropltious, unpatriotic, pernicious, and has consequence as vicious as a swarm of Jerman spies. All our logic and our reason prove it's nothing short of treason if we let the growing season 3nd us idly looking on, not consider-ng nor caring for the famine which is staring in our faces, nor preparing for the days when summer's gone. Let us then do what we ought to by devoting all our thought to saving foodstuffs as we’re taught to by the manuals complete which the Nation-%\ Commission has prepared in large edition for improving the condition yf our stock of things to eat. This s something worth your trying, for oy canning and by drying all the :hings that you’ve been buying you’ll aot merely feed yourselves, you’ll find, from the beginning that you’ve helped our troops in winning py the drying and the tinning which save stocked your pantry shelves.

Why the Exertion Makee the Lunge
Gasp For More Air.
It is hard to breathe after running awhile, because your body requires more blood in circulation. The efforts of your heart, brain and lungs make breathing difficult. We breathe to take air Into the lungs, where the blood which has once been through the arteries and comes back on its return trift to the heart is exposed to the air In the lungs before going back into the heart. The air which we take into our lungs purifies the once used bloôd and makes it into good blood again.
When you run the heart pumps blood Into your arteries faster to enable you

Cultivate It Earnestly, but Do Not
Carry It to Excess.
Thrift is a composite quality. It embraces within itself nearly all of the treat virtues. It involves Industry, prudence, forethought, self denial.
It certainly has no relation to niggardliness or meanness.
Some men would let their grandmothers starve for the sake of a few dollars. Such action cannot be called thrifty. A virtue carried to excess becomes a vice and is no longer a virtue.
Thrift that does not take into partnership honesty of character develops Into covetousness and avarice.
Thrift is the opposite of thriftlessness, prodigality, Improvidence and waste.
Thrift means better homes and better food, more comfort and enjoyment, less waste and less anxiety.
It Is possible that a large proportion of people have earnings so small that saving seems impossible. But this is no reason for their being unthrifty. On the contrary, it is reason for making the best and the most of the little they have for their health, comfort and true happiness.
A few dollars In a home or a savings bank, or any safe Invesment, is as good seed as ever was sown. •
Out of It grow confidence, quickened energies, firmer courage, more stalwart thought and hope, more orderly citizenship, education for the children and the Independence and self respect that lift aimless, hopeless drudges up to the true manhood that aspires and achieves. -Christian Herald.

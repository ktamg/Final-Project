Sir Alfred Mond, the First Commissioner of Works, London, England, is setting an example to local authorities in dealing promptly with food production in parks and open spaces. With the King’s approval he has given instructions Yor the grounds of the Convalescent Home for Officer» of the Navy and Army, at Osborne, Isle of Wight, to be planted with potatoes.
Before the war those portion* of the grounds open to the public, notably the Swiss Cottage gardens, were a blaze of color mil the summer. Very little gardening has been done since, but the decision of the First Commissioner of Works cannot fail to be an object-lesson in the use of idle ground.

But Not All of It, and So Their Testimony Was Misleading.
An attorney who has practiced law iu Indianapolis for many years formerly was counsel for a railroad company entering the city. He told the following story recently:
“I remember a damage case we had once which illustrates how easily the truth may mislead if another material fact Is withheld. A man had l*»cn killed hy a passenger train when crossing n grade n few miles out of Indiana polls. It was at night, and the rattle of his covered wagon prevented his hearing the approaching train.
“Two witnesses testified that no headlight was burning on the locomotive and that they did not hear any whistle.

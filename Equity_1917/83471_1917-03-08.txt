I This charwoman told her employer 'that at another house where she | worked the lady was always In mourning for a son who went dowi ! in the Hampshire. One day the charwoman found the lady dressed In white, and the lady told her that she had just received a letter from her son to say that he was a prisoner in Germany, having been saved from the wreck, and "you would be very much surprised to hear who is with me here.”
1 Inquiries were made, and the charwoman admitted that there was no such lady, but that the story came from some third party who could not be traced. She had added some of the circumstances herself. Another form is this*
A business man was told by the manageress of a factory connected with his business that one of the girls of the factory had had a letter from • her brother, who had been on the Hampshire, to say that he was a prisoner in Germany, and Lord Kitchener was with him. The girl, she said, had taken the letter to the War Office. Again, it wan found that the origin was that one girl had heard some such story from the untrace-able relative of a married sister. I The explanation of these personal legends is probably the same—the ancient human belief that a great hero cannot be overcome even by death, and the human desire to attain importance among strangers by claiming a personal connection with a great event.

Ing, the story told by Mies Dvoritsky in court was a strangely romantic one, and the breach of promise suit was the culminating point of four years of wandering that were filled
with tragedy and adventure. When only fourteen years of ago she was sent Vv her father, a wealthy Win* manufacturer _ of Borouovkbi to Jerusalem in Palestine to study the Bible and Jewish history. She had been in a seminary there for over two years wheu the war broke out, and she was driven from Palestine by the Government. On her way back to Russia she stopped at Alexandria, in Egypt, and there learned that the Germans in their first onrush at the beginning of the war had taken possession of her home town. In order to get to New York, from where she might communicate from a neutral country with her people, she taught in a private school at Cairo, and eventually reached New York. There a Jewish newspaper wrote about her that she was a graduate of a seminary in Palestine and was a cultivated, refined, and well-educated young lady.
As a result of this publicity she A was asked by Rabbi Gordon to come to Toronto and teach a kindergarten class about to be opened. She arrived in Toronto in August, 1915, and met Mr. Birnbaum, who was chairman of the committee responsible for the school. While continuing to teach school she conducted classes in pure Hebrew, and defendant became one of her pupils. From studying the two fell to love-making, and the question of marriage was first broached in Jan., 1910. Mr. Birnbaum came so often to the house where she roomed that the Jewish community began to think that they were engaged. The defendant's at-bec, Halifax, St. John, and Victoria tentions to her became so marked were made in legnls (Dominion that all her other gentlemen friends notes), but the following month, went into the background when money began to get tight, the the parties became engaged, and it banks wished to cone* ntrate and con- * as soon known that they were to be tralize cash reserves at convenient | married.

But the res|K>nse. we r egret to say, fell considerably short of expectations. The weather was tine, the oads good and there should have been a big crowd. The reverse was the fact. The reason for the aloofness may lie found, tieiliaps, in the knowledge of the match being between two Shawville teams, and the impression formed from that fact that they would not dish up anything very spicy. If that kept people from coming.
those who did honor the event with their patronage were not the l>eople who got fooled ; as all agreed that the match was a lively and interesting one.

An Old Voyageur.
One of the few remaining links in the past was revered last week when Narcisse Marlon, a French halfbreed, who has been living near Red Deer, Alberta, for the last thirty years, quietly passed away at the age of 68 years. He came from Manitoba in the early eighties, and was well known to the old timers in Central Alberta, and to know him was a real pleasure. He was truly representative of the •’Voyageurs” referred to by Whittier in his poem, "The Red River Voyageur,” and to know him intimately was to respect him abundantly. Perhaps in the stillness of the night, around the camp Ore, he would give you a glimpse of his beliefs in simple and quaint language. Nor were they very co plex or intricate, for he would say ;hat, in substance, he thought that a man who was honest and truthful and kind was living the life that the 3reat Spirit demanded and his life was more largely governed by his be-lef than perhaps some are influenced t>y a much more Involved theology. He bad a great kind heart, was courageous and determined, and possessed a native dignity which never, aoder any circumstance, failed him.

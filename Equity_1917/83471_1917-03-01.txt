"I A in a Cat."
The Japanese literary world Is mourning the death of Kinnosuke Natsume, better known by his pen name of ' Soseki," who was the lead- j ing exponent of Anglo-Saxon thought in Japanese literature.
Natsume went to England as Gov- ! eminent student in 1900 and soon began to write. A study of how English poets conceived nature establish- | ed for him a definite place in current ! Japanese thought.
Japan as a lecturer. Natsume published bis first novel under the unusual title, "1 Am a Cat." It created , a sensation iu the conventional world.
Nataume’s death mask was taken by the sculptor Taketaro Shinkal. The post-mortem examination by medical experts, which was made ar the author’s explicit desire, showed that the convolutions of his brain were unusually deep and that the brain weighed 75 grams more than the average Japanese man's, which weighs 1,350 grams.

him, bands played under his windows, adoring crowds followed him in the town, old Kossuth songs were revived in his honor. The steering gear of Austria-Hungary was in his hand. Not since Count Andrassy’s day, and not oven then, had a Hungarian statesman been so dominant in tho Dual Monarchy. It was known I ~ that his had been the hand to pen the dictatorial note to Serbia, and his popularity continues because it is now known that his were not the changes, but Count Bercbtold’s and Count Forgach’s, which made the note too severe for Serbia’s stomaching. For Count Tisza is Bismarck hid enough to have cautiously counted the costs.
His father before him, Count Kalman Tisza, led Hungary for eighteen uninterrupted years, and trained his son consistently for statesmanship. Count Stephen Tisza arrived not by accident. He comes near being the only statesman in the Dual Monarchy with courage, experience, resourcefulness, and indomitable health. Garbed always in gloomy black, courteous but abrupt, dry and brief, he is not a come-hither figure.
He looks a bit like Martin Luther, and he has the most celebrated racing stables in Hungary. Tall, almost gaunt, his gray hair is cropped criminally close. His eyes are pale gray and far-seeing. His face arrests you, the stern bones of the forehead and cheek, the straight, thin lips, the military carriage of his neck. No one recalls having seen him smile for years. And yet he is witty upon occasion.
A member of the consular corps at Budapest remembers discussing some little affair with him a few years ago. Both gentlemen kept their tempers and both were very much Irritated. When he got home from the interview, the consular officer found a huge basket of fruit there before

The Liberal papers called it spending booty when Mr. de Lukacs gave an official dinner to two hundred persons. The Balkan war was in progress, and the table at which Mr. de Lukacs and Count Tissa and the consular corps were seated gave itself over to a neutral discussion of
national foods. The French Consul | SYNOPSIS OF CANADIAN NORTH suggested that Hungarian foods were excellent, but perhaps rather piquant.

The Parks Committee of the London County Council reports that it has not been necessary to exercise the compulsory powers in regard to land for cultivation, the owners cheerfully giving up their land. Lord Derby's deer park at Knowaley has been ploughed up and more than one hundred acres are to be converted into wheat land. Motor tractors which cut from three to six furrows at a time were employed. Forty acres of the racecourse at Northampton, which has been used as a recreation ground since the abolition of racing, will be ploughed up.

An Arnprior report says : Many people in town are feeling keenly the lack of wood and coal. The limit was reached last week when a certain farmer asked ten dollars for a cord of hard wood.
lie could not sell it at that price and so decided to remain, in town over night, leaving his load of wood in a local livery yard.
In the morning ho was surprised to find his sleigh empty. Some unknown (ansons had carried off the wood during the night and a note was left saying : “That was fine wood. Bring another load at the same price.*'
The farmer has placed the matter in the hands of Chief Hunt.

The Great Pianist Was One of the Most Absentmindsd of Men.
That famous pianist and stilt more famous teacher of music, Theodore Leechetlzky. was one of the most ah seiitmimled of men.
One day, having experienced n slight symptom he thought ho would visit his doctor and provide against n repetition. The day was cloudy, and he started forth umbrella In hand. Before reaching the nearest avenue It began to sprinkle, and lie hailed n passing street car. Settled comfortably in u corner, be sank into meditation and was lost to material circumstances until the conductor announced: "End of route. Passengers will please descend."
Obediently the musician descended, lie had passed the doctor's house long ago; besides, he had forgotten where he was going. A friend who happened to pass a few moments later, found him standing on the curbstone—his umbrella up, although It was no longer raluing-glowering Intently ut the brimming gutter as he tried to remember his errand. Explanations followed, and the friend laughingly advised him to return home.

"Not at all; not at all I" cried Les-•hetlxky, beaming. "My dear fellow, you have told me my domination. I, too. was going to Dr. So and so for a prescription."
The friends proceeded to the doctor's and obtained the two prescriptions. They left together, and on the top step -the sun was now shining brilliantly— the musician paused absent in Indedly nice more to put up his umbrella.
"But. my good friend, you do not need your umbrella," remonstrated bis friend. "The rain ceased an hour ago."

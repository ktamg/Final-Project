The Yukon Is about 200 miles longer than the Mississippi, but It )s 2,000 miles shorter than the Missouri Mississippi, measured from the Rocky Mountains In Montana, and from Itasca Lake In Minnesota. It Is properly called one of the great rivers of North America, and It Is as difficult to navigate as the most contrary them
and the Mississippi, south of their Junction, It sometimes spreads over a vast expanse of country, but that Is not conducive to traveling unices one is aboard a very light and very fiat bottomed craft. From Fort Selkirk, where the stream Is formed by the Junction of the Lewes and Felly rivers, it flows north-westward into Alaska, where it takes a generally south-west course, emptying, after meandering in a manner that would put the St. Johns of Florida to the blush, into the Behring Sea.
It used to be told of the early explorers of the Mississippi that, after entering the delta, they never knew how they got inside, and that, after passing through It to the Gulf, they never knew how they got outside. It was many years before the navigators fixed upon landmarks which enabled them to steer in anything like a straight course
splendid engineer, Captain James B. Eads, came along with his Jetties, they were uncertain whether they would find a channel, or would ground on a sandbar.
The mariner regards the delta of the Yukon as hopeless. The stream, to begin with, empties great quantities of sediment, so that not only the passes, but sections of the iea beyond, are filled with the deposit. Only a few feet of water can be found for a long distance from the mouths of the twenty-six outlets. As

How The Woodchuck Chucked Wood.
One morning old Mr. Woodchuck stepped out early to take a look at the •ky.
"It's burrowing weather," he said to bis wife when he came in and sat down at the breakfast table.

“After breakfast, Willy," said Mrs. Woodchuck, “you must bring in the
No proof is needed of the valor of the Belgians, the French and the British. It would be idle to speak of it, because for three years they have shown the height of human courage in most damnable and deadly places.

After breakfast Willy Woodchuck went out to the woodpile. Such a big woodpile! But of course if you leave a week’s work to be done in a day, that is not the fault of the wood-

Willy Woodchuck took up two or three chunks and chucked them through the cellar window. One of the chunks hurt his paw. Perhaps he had a splinter!
He sat down fra stump to look at his paw. He took his knife out of his pocket.
“What are you doing?" asked Sammy Skunk.
Now, Willy Woodchuck’s mother had told him never to play with Sammy Skunk, because Sammy Shunk's manners are bad. Willy Woodchuck remembered at once. \
“Nothing," he said.
“That’s a fine knife,” said Sammy Skunk.
Willy Woodchuck opened his paw so Sammy Skunk could see.

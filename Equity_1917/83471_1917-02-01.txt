To demonstrate in every way the agricultural possibilities of Northern Ontario it is proposed now to establish a creamery at New Liskeard on the Temlskamlng and Northern Ontario Railway. The Ontario Department of Agriculture has already been engaged in selecting a type of dairy animal that will be suitable to the northern climate, and In order that settlers and farmers may have a market available the creamery will bo established.
To meet the demand for agricul- I tural labor the Director of Colonisa» | tion is sending agents to points In the United States for the purpose of article* attracting men looking for this class of work to Ontario during the coming summer
, tried with considerable success, and | as the supply of that class of labor is even larger now, It is expected that an Increased number will take advantage of the opportunity. Farmers desiring assistance should communicate with the Director of Colonization before the first of February and the applications will be dealt with in the order of receipt.

JOB PRINTING
: An Impertinent Advertisement.
I When many are endowing advertising with the attributes of the arts I and sciences it comes as a shock to j find a regalia company In an Amerl-I can city making merry, in a Cana-j dlan circular, over the fact that Can-I ada is at war and the United States is not. The circular is sent to heads of fraternal societies in the Dominion. and It declares in jingle that the coin is easier than the sword war don't worry us a bit, no chance —for we are out of it.' kind of banter the Jingle runs on, tilling Canadians with wonder at the impertinent stupidity of the man who hopes thus to sell regalia in Canada
is wrong with the mind of that man In the United States who hopes to sell regalia by bantering and ridiculing Canadians for being at war, while chuckling with delight over the recalcitrance of his own country. If this is the new advertising, the old will be found more effective. —The Globe.

Lieut. Hal B. Gordon Considered a Writer With m Future.
“Hal" Gordon, considered by many to be among the most promising of the younger writers connected with Toronto newspapers, is one of the Canadians who fell fighting for liberty whose loss may be described as In a town In the heart of Russian I national. That he would In time tait fields many houses are built of have been known throughout th*
breadth of the Dominion If be had been spared to carry on his work as a writer, few who knew his gifts doubted. When the war broke out "Hal" Gordon was one of the first Toronto writers selected to go to England as a war correspondent, but he was not content to be a mere onlooker at such a time. He was a quiet, thoughtful religious man with a deep devotion to duty, and it was typical of him that he should have enlisted in the ranks for active service. His ability won him rapid promotion. and he was given a commission in the spring of 1915 in line for further promotion when he fell fighting on June 13th, 1918.
All that is mortal of the late Lt ' Hal" B. Gordon lies buried In Flanders, but his life, us embodied in the memories of those who were I associated with him Btill “carries T ol/ The building of the Baraca Club of Toronto was the scene oT a unique gathering recently, when the J assembly-room was crowded with the friends of Lieut.

Timidly she pulled hack the latch and peered out. A gentleman stood on the threshold with his face towards the river. At the sound of the opening door, he turned. Down went the candle with a crash and splutter; up went the two hands to her face.

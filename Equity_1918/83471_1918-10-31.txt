Sending Money to Soldiers
Those who have friends or relatives at the front, may wish to send money, but possibly do not know the best way to do so.
the safest and most of making remittances abroad is the Hank Money Order or Draft, as issued by The Merchants Bank.
If, however, it is necessary to send money without delay, the Bank will arrange this by Cable Transfer.

NOTICE TO MILK PATRONS.
We are within sight of Victory, and now, less than ever, can we afford to rest in a false atmosphere of security.
Now is the moment for a grand r*IIy, an irresistible push forward with men and money.
The men are there—and always fresh ones go They must continually be fed, clothed, and supplied with ammunition. The work of supporting them, the EASY PART, is ours. Shall, any one of us fail them at this end ?
No, a hundred times, NO !
And what are we asked to do ? What is it that Canada asks of us ?
Simply to LEND to our ow n Count!y more money, that the great fight may be finished for us, and that the sacrifices made for us in four years of war shall not be in vain. No thinking man or woman who realizes this can fail to resjxmd to the limit of bis or her ability.
And Canada makes it very easy for us to do this through

A Word to the Boys
Halloween falls on Thursday of this week. We do not say this as a reminder in case the boys should allow the time-honored mischiefmaking event to pass unobserved, because there is not the remotest liklihootl of their, forgetting about it ; but we speik of it to advise them in a kindly way against committing any excesses that in after years they would have reason to be ashamed of. Indulge in all the innocent fun you can, but do not commit the error of destroying the property of anybody, because it is a ciime to do so ; and to take pleasure in doing a thing which inflicts damage or loss upon anyone, is simply doing in a modified form what the Huns are doing in Belgium and Fiance these days. Let decency govern your actions and you won’t have anything to regret.
We have 68 men’s heavy winter overcoats at last year’s prices, which is 40% below to-day's prices. Call and see them. Dover.

Success.
Sir Louis Davies 1ms been appointed to succeed Sir Charles Fitzpatrick as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. The appointment of the latter to the Lt. Governorship of Quebec is adversely criticized by some of the French newspapers of the province, which consider that the right of holding the office belongs to a French-Canadian.

The Renfrew Truck Scale
To Save Veeeele From Sinking.
Interest has boon aroused by an apparatus that has lately been developed to save ocean vessels from sinking after being torpedoed or damaged by collision. The contrivance, which Is shown In Popular Mechanics Magasine, comprises a laminated steel disk, to the center of which Is attached a series of rubberized canvas cone shaped buckets. In use, the end cono dd the chain would be lowered Into w#t%r In the vicinity of the hole in a ship’s hull. Upon being caught by the lnrushlng water, lt would be pulled through the opening. The whole string 3f buckets would then be lowered along with the disk so that the latter would be pulled In place over the 3reek. The cones, being of flexible material, would be able to pass through an aperture, regardless of Its shape. The disk, once In place, would be held >y the pressure of the water against the hall.

The Menace of the Hun.
Four year* we have been fighting The Hun in all him might,
Hut now the day ia dawning For the triumph of the right The enemy ii fleeing,
We must ke^p jiim on the run.
Till we rid the world forever From the menace of the Hun.
f
The world is steeped in morrow,
Our best blood has flowed in stream# I To stay a vain usurper
And dispel hi* world-power dreams. But the lay of retribution Is at hand, and sure to tome,
Whop God’s own *word of justice Will descend upon the Hun.
To those whose dearly loved one# [ Will no more return again,
Tis a glorious consolation T) at they have not died in vain. They on the field of battle
Fared the foe man’s blade find gun, To save their homes and country From the menace of the Hun.
The dark clouds now are rifted And soon the strife will cease,
Soon ours will be the victory And ours the terms of peace.
So still we’ll bravely “Carry On"
Till we the war have won,
And the world is safe forever From the menace of the Hun.

Robert Stead s New Novel
Robert J. C. Stead, in his new novel, “The Cow Puncher, (Toron to, the Musson Book CogH I cloth, $1.50), has written a notable book with a Western Canada setting
puncher of the story, grows to young manhood on a latvh in the foothills, outside the influence of church or school. At eighteen he is accidentally thrown into the com panv of a young Eastern girl, who enkindles in him the ambition to be somebody in the world.
With this purpose in view, young Elden leaves the ranch and goes to make his fortune in a
young Western city,_____The first
night he is swindled out of all his ready cash by a gang of card sharpers, and he takes a job next morning as a coal heaver For a time it looks as though Dave’s course would be downward instead of up, but he fortunately come* under influences which revive his ambition for self-betterment.
About this time the big western real estate boom breaks out, and Dave’s course is meteoric. His wealth come* quickly and goes as quickly. Following the collapse of the boom a tragedy in his love affairs sends him as an enlisted man to France. In the closing chapters is found one of the highest patriotic notes struck by any author during the war.
“The Cow Puncher” is decidedly worth while It is interesting and refreshing, and at times inspiring, written with all Mr. Steads inti mate knowledge of the West and skill of delineation. Through the book runs a happy vein of humor and philosophy which is not the least of its charms. It is illustrated by Arthur Heming, ex-lumber man and North-West Mounted | policeman, and is announced by i

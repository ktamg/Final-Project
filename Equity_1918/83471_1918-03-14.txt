Quite likely you have been too busy poking the fire to think about the raspberry and blackberry canes. Some nice day put on a pair of long-wrist-cd leather gloves and go at the trimming. Cut out all dead or unthrifty canes entirely, and prune back the others (including side branches) about one-third. Burn the trimmings and thus get rid of pests.

relief resulting from the quick application of the potato, even in cases of bad burns. In every home potatoes are at hand, and it takes but ment to grate enough potato to spread thickly over a burn. There will be instant relief and no blisters later. Cover the burned area well with the grated potato and then bind on soft cloths. In case of a very serious burn where a good deal of flesh has been destroyed, do not rely on home treatment except for temporary relief, but send for a physician immediately.

Sausage Makers' Repartee.
An old story which Is king revived nowaday* concerns two rival sausage makers. They lived on opposite sides if a certain street In London, and one lay one of them placed over his shop the legend. "We Fell sat sages to the gentry and nobility of the country. The next day, over the way. appeared the >ign, "We sell sausages to the gentry and nobility of the whole country." Not to be outdone, the rival put up what he evidently regarded as a fir il statement, namely: "We sell sausages to the king." Next day there appeared over the door of the first «irsage maker the simple expression )f loyalty. "God save the king."

"Marmalade forever!" This quaint battle cry originated from u certain Scotch regiment during a charge In the present war, says London Am •wers. "Stand, the Cameron* !" Is the roar of another regiment of the "kilt-lea," and serves to corroborate the fact that as official report* have It, "the spirit of our troopo Is excellent."
Among others there Is the gallant cry of "Stick It, Welsh!" uttered by the late Captain Haggard, which haa been an Inspiration to many Welsh hards. It Is sad to recall that Capt. M Langdale, whilst encouraging Ms men with the gallant cry of "Come on, the Lelceaterahlres !” fell on the field. But the Leicestershire did "come on,” with disastrous results to the Huns.
We must not forget, however, that fa mot i cry of "Kamerad!" uttered by whole German regiments, which has perhaps, encouraged our men more than any othesL There Is an amusing tale told of one of our Tommies who, during u charge, was about to give a certain Hun a glimpse of the "great beyond," when up went Frits’s hands.

The ready adaptability of rats to their surroundings Is one of the qualities which has enabled them to con-luer the world, EX W. Nelson writes n the National Geographic Magazine. On the approach of warm weather In summer large numbers of them leave buildings and resort to fields on ?i -ms or to the outskirts of the towns, where the growing vegetation, particu-arly cultivated plants, affords them 11 abundant supply until the approach jf winter. At the beginning of cold weather they return again to the shelter of buildings, where they find the harvested crops ready for their consumption.
When the food supply suddenly de-?rcase% following a period of plenty luring which the rats have greatly Increased In numbers, a migratory Impulse appears to affect the entire rat population over large areas and a general migration takes place. At mrh times the rats are extraordinarily bold, swimming rivers without hesitation. and surmounting all other natural obstacles. The first Invasion of Europe. when rats swam the Volga, was an Instance of this kind. Experiments by the United States public health service have shown that when released in the water of a harbor rats may

Tt Is not very often that these members of one family take the town by storm simultaneously, but this, says the Christian Science Monitor, Is the record of the Oeddeses—push-and-gc Oeddesseg, they have been termed. Sir Eric Geddes has not long become first lord of the British admiralty; he has done a great many things and astonished a vast number of people since the war began ; his brother, Dr. Campbell Geddes, is now the head of national recruiting on a civilian basis— to be Intrusted with the writing of a fresh chapter in the history of recruit ing nt this stage of the proceedings Is In Itself the highest testimony to high qualities. The third Geddes to win prominence is the sister of these two brothers, Mrs. Chalmers Watson, who, after performing valuable serv Ices in France, has now become commander In chief of the new Women'!

M


HIS is the WAR FLOUR of the OGILVIE MILLS—a loyal product to conserve Canada's resources and, at the same time, give the public the best possible flour that can he milled according to the Government standard.
This War Flour is excellent in quality and flavor—but it is slightly darker in color than “ROYAL HOUSEHOLD to which you have been accustomed.
It is just as hard for us to give up milling “ROYAL HOUSEHOLD” as it will be for you to forego your favorite brand; hut our “STANDARD” Flour will nevertheless make delicious bread, rolls, biscuits, cake, pies and pastry. If you have any difficulty—just drop us a line; we have a staff of expert chemists and bakers, whose experience is at your service.
Just as soon as the Food Controller will allow us to mill “ROYAL HOUSEHOLD” again, we will tell you of this happy fact.

ORE than 100,000 Fords are owned by people in Canada in preference to the old horse-dra buggy and other makes of cars.
Your neighbors, and farmers in every section of the Dominion are abandoning their old buggies—selling their driving horses and buying Fords.
Ford cars are utility cars. They are built to endure the strain of constant daily use over rough roads.
These are the tests every farmer gives his car. The Ford meets them in a satisfactory manner. It is the farmer’s car, so why not replace your horse and buggy with a Ford?

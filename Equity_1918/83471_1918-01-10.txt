Purchase of Quebec Bank Adds 20 Millions—Total Increase During 1917 is 82 Millions.
The Royal Bank of Canada’s statement shows a continuance of the rapid growth that has marked the recent history of the institution, u growth accelerated in the past year by the absorption of the Quebec Bank j on January 1st last.	*
The purchase of the Quebec Rank added something like 20 millions to the assets of the Royal. That^how-vver, accounts for a relatively small part of the expansion, for the increase in total assets as compared with Nov- j ember, 1910, amounts to more than 82 millions. In the past three years the bank has practically doubled tho resources at its command; they are approximately seven times the ,total of only ten years ago.

"Nor* Stior' Yemen" Come From
New Brunswick.
I Another Canadian poet who ia finding hie material in a part of the Dominion not hitherto treated In verse has just come before the Canadian public. In "Nor* 8hor* Verse*" Richard D. Ware ha* put Into poetic form tbe dialect spoken by the people who live on the north shore of New Brunswick, between tbe Miramlchi and the Bay of Chaleur. Mr. Ware tells us In hi* abort introduction that most of the people who live in this part of Gloucester arc French, descendant* of the oldtime Acadian*. These Canadians, that is the fishers, the farmers, and the lumbermen among them, speak a broken English to enable them to mix with tbelr English fellow-cltl-sens, who do not attempt to talk French. In their patois, Mr. Ware has written bis poetry. It Is hardly necessary to add that one is reminded at once of the Inimitable Habitant poems of the late Dr. Drummond, but in spite of that fact Mr. Ware ham put Individuality into his work. HI* verses tell of different phases of the life of these workers, and he sketches into them a nice appreciation of Canadian scenery. In a poem like "The Silver Thaw" for example, one gets a picture that calls to mind familiar scenes:
W'en de storm she go an' de sun he shine
R* gee. It mak* great sight,
W'en all de fleV an' bush an vine I Mak* rainbow wit' do light;
De win' she mak dem Jomp an* play. An* ‘ah-la? In de ear Soun* leetle bell lak cloches des fays Meex een de air you hear.
There are many little bits of description as effective a* that In Mr. Ware's slender volume of poetry. One only regrets that it is impossible to quote one of the longer poems In full to demonstrate how Mr. Ware catches the atmosphere of the country and suggests the character of | these men, with their primitive humors. But space will only permit the use of one of the shorter poems, which does not show the writer at hi* best. It is entitled "The Teamster*" :
Aw. de haulin'# well mos' done; Anodder touch o' sun Rure mak' de road a fright, altogedder. De ice she goln* fas an* cet never boun* to lam'

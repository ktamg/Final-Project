Mr. Farmer, -1)o you realize that your barns, silos and other outbuildings are worth hundreds of dollars more than before the war, owing to the advance in labor and all kinds of building material, and that you simply cannot afford to allow them to remain exposed to the weather. Unprotected they rapidly depreciate in value.

Freddie Klock returned from the Kipewn district on Sunday ill with influenza. A couple of other Clarendon boys accompanied Fred, and they also were ill with the prevailing malady. With the exception of Fred's case there has been no increase of the disease in Shaw ville since our last issue, and about hall the number who have been under quarantine, were considered sufficiently recovered on Monday to be liberated. Shaw-vllle has been very fortunate in having thus far, at least, comparatively few cases, with no fatalities inside of the corporation.

NoteThis-TIic law governing contagious diseases provides that medical certificates may be demanded from parties going from one municipality to another, to show that they have not come from households where cases exist of any contagious disease. Failing to show such certificate, the party may be quarantined and held in custody for six days at his own expense. People will do • well to avoid getting into trouble. Shn w-ville has found it necessary to appoint an officer whose duty it is to see that parties coming into town from places where no precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of the present epidemic, have a clean bill of health.

Fred C. Hodoins
The first death from pneumonia, in this immediate neighborhood occurred on Friday night last, the victim of the dread disease being Fred C. Hod gins, second son of Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Hodgins, who were speeding homeward from the West at the time, in hopes, no doubt, that they would reach here iu time to see their boy, who was only IV years old. still alive. They did not anive, however, till the following evening, thus adding, as it were to the great grief they are called upon to bear.
The deceased returned from the West only a week or so before he became ill ; in fact, lie was not well when he got home having not quite recovered from an attack of congestion of the lungs. Reaching here lie undertook to assist his brother with some of the Fall work that remained, and was working in the potato field as late the day before his condition became serious. This was characteristic of his nature—always ready and willing, when there was anything to do. Besides his bereft Imrents he is survived by two sisters—Mr*. Harold H. Hodgins and Mrs. George H. Fades ; also two brothers —Gilbert in the West and Clifton at home, all of whom have the dee|>est sympathy of the community in their great sorrow.
The funeral took place to the Methodist cemetery on Sunday afternoon, the Rev. Mr. Tripp officiating.
Got Bear in Door Yard.—On Tuesday of last week, Mrs. Harvey Black, who lives in the neighborhood of Campbells Bay, met a young bear in the door-yard, ns she was about to start out for the cows. The animal made towards her, but nothing daunted she seized a good stick, and succeeded in making Bruin shin up a tree that stands near the end of the woodshed. She then called to her h usband, who was in a field some distance off. Mr. Black hurried to the house and procuring his rifle, put a couple of bullets into his beaiship, but these did not bring him down, and he had to l>e beaten out of the tree with a stick.
A man named Payette had an encounter with a very large she bear in the same neighborhocxl a short time previously, in which, he came off second best, because he could not get his rifle to go off, and lie had to take leg bail. Payette says the l>ear was accompanied by five cubs.

Milton Klock Dies from Wounds
The sympathy of the community is with Dr. and Mrs. Klock and family in their great sorrow, caused by the death of their son Milton, who succumbed to wounds received in action a few days previously. When intelligence first reached Dr. Klock it stated that Milton had been dangerously wounded. Then, in a day or two came the
reassuring message that the danger was past. It can be imagined how great was the shock the family received when on Monday morning another message bore the sad news of the soldier-boy s death.

The toll of death has been very heavy around Renfrew and neighborhood, chiefly from the prevailing epidemic. Last week’s Mercury contained more than a score of obituary notices, the subjects of which were mostly people who had fallen victims to the disease. The list includes a notice of the death of Mrs. O’Brien, wife of Hon. M. J. O’Brien, who passed away at the age of 55 years.
Last week’s Arnprior j>«|>ers contains notice of the death of Claude Daniel McPhee, third son of Mr. James McPhee, from bronchial pneumonia, after a few days illness, at the age of 84 years. The deceased was a son-in-law of ( apt. Mailes Cowley, of Bristol, having married eight years ago, Miss Hattie E. Cowley", who with one little daughter survives. His remains were interred at Arnprior.

Notes from Rooney, published in our last issue, have got this paper into trouble again because of an objectionable item escaping the eye of the censor. We find, on quiry that the name given as •iter of the notes in question was a forgery, to make matters worse. We have, therefore, come to the conclusion that our only safety and protection lies in the exclusion of this class of matter from The Equity altogether, unless it is handed into the office by parties whom we know and can trust Henceforward all that comes through any other channel will lie consigned to the wnst#
basket.

We ask you to buy for service rather than merely for style; to go to a reliable dealer, and to look for the manufacturer’s trade-mark on the shoes. By so doing you may be assured of good value for your money.

DUUÎistkm of Wood.
I ; The destructive distillation of hard I woods is the only important distillaI tier* industry in Canada where wood I is used as raw material. There an* »j rcw 11 plants in Ontario and Quebec and the industry is well organised. It is gratifying to note that manufacture is carried beyond the stage of the crude products, where so many of Canada’s industrial activities cease, and that the specially refined and derived products are produced in Canada for local and export trade. In the I liinitid list of chemicals which are regularly exported from Canada there are only three of much importance,
1 namely, calcium carbide, acetate of j lime and methyl alcohol, the last two of which are entirely produced by i hardwood distillation. It is important to remember that practically all the wood alcohol and acetic acid which are so essential to modern civilization are produced by the destructive distillation of hardwoods. The plants in Canada consume, # in the aggregate, over 600 corda of wood per day. Maple, beech and birch are the principal species used, although oak, hickory and other hard woods are suitable if obtainable.

MAN may well feel proud to have raised stock, grain, fruit or vegetables that will stand comparison with the bedt his neighbour can produce.
The exhibition gives you an opportunity to show your bedl work, and to see what others have been producing.
It natural to want to win a prize or a ribbon. The desire puts you on your mettle, and even though you may not win the coveted prize, the effort you make will mean an improvement in your whole year’s production.
It is this constant striving that keeps all live people up to the mark. We, as manufacturers, have a tremendous responsibility to spur us on. We know our success depends on the perfedt satisfaction of the millions of Gillette Razor users who daily enjoy the real luxury of a faultless shave.
The every-day shaver has put the “blue ribbon" on the Gillette Razor. His hearty commendation makes his friends want to buy the famous safety razor. It would do you good to hear him.
At the Exhibition, you will see thousands of men who owe their clean, fresh appearance largely to the Gillette. Suppose you step into a jewelry, drug, or hardware store, and look over the assortment of Gillette sets. '
Your year’s work has entitled you to “treat” yourself to a Gillette, and you will say, as the years go by, that it was the be.<t five dollars you ever invested.

When one of these low-comedy vehicles (named the Creme-de-Menthe) ambled down the mam street of the hitherto impregnable village of piers with hysterical British Tommies slapping her on the back, he appealed to the civilized world to step in and forbid the combination of vulgarism and barbarity.

The Ford truck is supplied as a chassis only. This permits you to select any of the many body styles especially designed for the Ford truck and already on the market. Thus you can mount the one which suits your individual requirements.

Rev. Dr. Russell in Ottawa
A unique and interesting feature in the meetings being held in Ottawa by l)r. Walter Russell in the lni|>erial Theatre last Sunday night was a large company of his old Pontiac friends. A large section of the theatre was reserved and a banner card hung over it with PONTIAC inscribed.
Dr. Russell said that he had the honor of going to the country school in Bristol with sixty txiys and girls who became professional men and women, legislators, statesmen and business men of large interests.
It was an inspirational occasion, and the message was one of prophetic pas •ion and Apostolic fire, in the Length, Breadth, Depth and Height of the Love of God.
The Russell party have l>een asked to lead a great Ten Days Convention in June for all the towns and cities for a radius of one hundred miles with Ottawa as a centre.
Pontiac ought to contribute a large contingent for a Feast oi Pentecost.

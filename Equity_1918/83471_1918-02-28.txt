A great shortage of feed is reported from England. According to a recent Mtatement made by Mr. R. E. Prothero, President of the Board of Agriculture, there were only enough oats available in Britain to feed working horses on re bleed rations after making allowance ror milling stocks. There was no concentrated food for cattle feeding and ibis shortage would continue for at least T year, he declared. He was afraid that all carriage horses which had not been sent out to grass would have to be killed, white hunters would have to be sent to grass and kept there.

WONDER
Mexico an Indian Country?
It Is of Importance to inquire into he attitude taken by the southern julians of Mexico toward the official Spanish civilization, says the New Re-lublic. If it is difficult for an outsider only slightly acquainted with the southern IYidians to understand the easons for their marked hatred of he Spaniards ... It seems self-•vident of anyone who has spent any ime with them. To the southern Italians. the Spaniard and his successor, he Spanish-speaking Mexican, is the •ruel alien conqueror. They feel that hey are Indians and that Mexico Is n Indian country. For instance, one if the common objections to Madero •ncountered in Oaxaca was that he vas not an Indian and that the presl-lent of Mexico should be an Indian, "his attitude Is significant, and it la iot strange to find even a northern ndian like Huerta proudly exclalm-ng: “Yo so Indiano.” if popularity in the south is not so tmch due to the fact that southern iexico Is the home of Diaz as to the act that Carranza Is not an Indian.

For some unexplained reason the carrot does not seem to be as much of a homo garden vegetable as some others which have not so much food value and are not as toothsome or enjoyable in as many ways. I have noticed this to be the case in many parts of the country, and yet it is very extensively grown by market gardeners and must be eaten by many in the cities.
To get a well-grown carrot special attention must be given to the soil, which should be light in texture, very fertile, deep and warm.
The carrot has a long growing sea-Thc early ones may be sown now and others successively through the months of May, June and the first half of July in much quantities as will give a summer supply from the first plantings, and from the later ones what is desired for winter.
Cover the seeds thinly with fine soil, and to make sure of a good contact between it and the seeds tread along the row to make it firm, especially when planting the late ones, when the soil may be somewhat dry. Keep watered enough to maintain an even moisture, which will hasten germination and insure a more even crop. The carrot should be grown quickly to insure freedom from toughness of the centre.

Foremost among edible greens is the spinach. This is one of the most important crops of both the commercial and home gardeners, yet it is not always as choice as it can be made to be by proper culture. By some it is regarded almost as a spring medicine, having a diuretic effect. When properly cooked and served it is both nourishing and appetizing.

make a good edging for the beds of almost all vegetables, and this makes for economy of space. The practice of making a hole with a stick and dropping in the seeds is not a good one, as it is difficult to provide close contact between the seed and the soil, something which is very necessary.
The best plan is to sow the seeds in drills one inch deep. These can be made with the hoe, which is better than the back of the rake, as it doef not pack the soil in the bottom of the drill. Set the seeds an inch wpart, in order to get a good stand, as some may not germinate, and when they have gained their third leaf they may be thinned out to two inches apart in the row. /
These plants are allowed to remain at this distance until the leaves touch,

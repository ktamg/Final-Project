This was the first sensation of consciousness that returned to him lie was too weak to speak, nor was he able to see, for he has since been totally blind, one eye. the left, he felt lying on his cheek and later pushed into the socket when strength came to him. The right eye is recovering and there are hopes that It will be strong. A wound in the throat almost severed his windpipe, another was at the back of the neck and others about the face. He was in full dress uniform at the time, hut was so covered with blood that he was absolutely unrecognizable as he lay In the morgue.
Three times he was approached In the morgue after he became conscious. The first was when he heard the voices, the second was when footsteps sounded but did not come near, the third was after a longer time and he had been able to turn on his hands and knees. How long this might have been he has no idea, for his firs: real consciousness came to him In the hospital.

Last Wednesday s Ottawa papers contained notices of the death at Chicago, III., on Feby 4th, of a gentleman who back in the .seventies was well known to many people in Pontiac, especially those who list'd the old Ottawa river transportation facilities provided by the l . F. and H Co. We refer to Capt. George C. Bolton, who in turn commanded the steamers Jason Gould, Prince Arthur (burned at P. I). Fort) and the Sir John Young. When the Co. went out of business Capt. Bolton took a position m the Auditor General's Office, and was later on the House of Commons staff. He removed to Chicago about 23 years ago, where he has since resided. He was in his 79th year. Deceased was an uncle of Dr. R. H. Klock of tin* village.

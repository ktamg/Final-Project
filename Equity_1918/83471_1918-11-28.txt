You do not have to forego sweet things because of tho present shortage of sugar. Corn Syrup is available, and for years has been available, as a perfect alternative for su/?ur for cooking. in puddings and preserves, in the making of desserts, and on cereals.
People didn't recognize this fact while sugar was cheap and plentiful. Now they are hailing the discovery with delighted surprise.
Buy Crown Brand or Lily White Com Syrup from your grocer. They are wholesome, delicious and nourishing—true products of the Com—and, you will soon llnd, most economical, too.

This part of Artois is a country of low chalk downs and wide shallow valleys, under cultivation up to the very edges of the spoil banks, or crassiers, that surround the mouths of the pits.

The fourth corps took over the new sector, and on Sept. 25 the Loos attack was launched by the first, fifteenth and forty-seventh divisions, the latter composed entirely of London Territorials. The fighting lasted until Oct. 13, by which time the British line had been advanced to a considerable depth over a wide front.
But the dominating position of Hill 70, north of Lens, from which observation can be obtained into the town itself and over much of the country beyond, had not been won, despite desperate efforts on the part of the guards division on the days following the first assault; nor was a frontal attack made upon the town

It was not until the spring of 1917 that any further attempt was made upon this sector, although early in 1916 the Germans succeeded in driving the British from some trenches bout Souchez. But on April 9, 1917, the British first and third armies delivered an attack on a wide front, of which the northern sector was the ground before Lens.
The Canadian divisions, by the capture of Vimy Ridge, made the German positions in this area untenable, anfl forced them to withdraw. By the evening of April 14, the whole of the town of Lievin was in Canadian hands, and the line ran thence to the old British front line north of the double crassier. Great quantities of ammunition of all calibres, as well aa several guns, and stores and material of every kind were abandoned

He Is a boy in the house of a picture dealer. He has been discovered ’taking the pen from the desk of his employer and letting It run agreeably to his fancy. One of his masterpieces of an Idle moment came by chance under the eyes of his employer.
"Did you do that?” asked the employer.

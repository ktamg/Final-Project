Reminiscences of the cradle and infancy of art In Canada were charmingly given In a recent address by Mr F. M. Hell Smith, the well-known Canadian painter, Mr. Bell-Smith prefaced his remarks by saying that “art In Canada to-day is not merely fanciful, but Is a wholesome and very valuable reality/' He made a brief reference to Jacobi, one of the beat colorists who had ever come to Canada from Europe, and to Paul Kane and to Krelghoff, a Russian Pole, who won not a little fame as the painter of “habitant" life In the Province of Quebec.
It was, however, left to Mr. Bell-Smith's father, John Bell-Smith, to found the first society of artists In Canada Till» was just after I he settled in Montreal In, 186#. He was Its first president.

Opinion of a Canadian Rack From
the Front.
“I don’t know how far back my family dates In Canada," said a Canadian soldier, "but I know that my grandfather was born there and his father before him. I reckon that I'm a real Canadian, all right, and naturally I’m glad when I hear my own place cracked up. But I’m getting kind of sick at hearing the Canadians being praised to death, while the English troops get so little said about them. It isn’t that our fellows don't fight all right, but j when you get down to It I reckon we don't fight any better than any other of the British troops. In a way, I know it’s the fault of the English themselves that they don’t get any advertisement. They’re too quiet.
"It’s the same over In France. If the English troops get a job to do. they just turn up the cuffs of their tunics, screw on their tin helmets a bit, and walk Into It, sucking their teeth. They never seem to get hotted up like us. We Canadians and the Australians always seem to know when we’re in on a big scene, but the English troops pPev the same way all the time. You can put them Into the most awful hole, give them the most heart breaking job, and they just do the business In that same reflective sort of way, never realizing that they're doing anything out of the day’s work. They're like nothing so much as a lot of terriers and bulldogs—terriers for quickness and bull dogs for grit and patience.
"That’s the wonderful thing about the home troops; they've got the unbreakable limit for patience. I always like to see them clearing a Boche trench. They Just go along It and clean out every funk-hole quiet and business-like. If they’ve got to hold a bit of line against Boche counter-attacks, they’ll hang on, by the skin of their teeth. There Isn’t a quitter In the whole mob. Then look at the length of the line they hold—why, the little bit that the overseas troops holds Is only the tiniest little fraction of it. If you ask me, I say that the what you call 'English line regiemnts’ are the backbone of the army, and its ribs, too. You can go where you like, France, Mesopotamia, Palestine, Egypt, Africa, Macedonia, and you’ll find that the English are there doing the main part of the business In the same quiet, reflective kind of a way. No fuss; just quiet, patient work.
"I’m not running down my own crowd, mind you, or the Australians or New Zealanders or any of the overseas crush. They’ve shown what they can do, and there’s no denying they’ve done it well; and I will say that they’ve got credit for It. When you think of what the English fellows have done without any noise about It in the press. It makes you think that we get more than our •hare of praise. I tell you what It Is, though. The English people are taken with the idea of us fellows coming all that way to light—and 11 is kind of romaot'c

“Dust to dust, ashes to ashes, in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life!”
We walked back when the service was over to the Y.M.C.A. That walk is a place of pilgrimage, where thousands of men and women will come after the war to pay tribute to the last resting place of their dead. “Somewhere in France,” with brilliant-colored flowers over them. A joyous little garden nods over each man’s grave.

Out in the queer, old-fashioned courtyard a father was pacing up dc,. a alone. He was a kindly, #i ly man from the far north of Scotland, fond of a “crack” (chat) with his neighbors. But to-night no one dared speak to him. He was fighting the shadow alone.
It was only yesterday that he had a great story to tell. His boy was “doin' fine.” They had had to amputate his leg, but he was putting up a real stiff fight. Who would give fresh life blood to turn the balance ?

Now it was the father who must fight alone. What should he write to the boy’s mother and sister home in Scotland ? None of us dared speak to him as he paced slowly up and down the old French courtyard.
There was an American mother, too, who had crossed two seas to see her boy, her only son. Her whole life Was bound up in him. Her whole conversation was of his early days, his goodness, his fine working capabilities, his kindness to her.
For two long weeks she had been under a haunting fear which she would not name, Spartan that she was.
After the visit to the hospital she came back smiling.
Yes, he had recognized her. He looked very white and thin, but he was somehow just the same bright boy as always. The shot had touched (ne spine and there was little pain. She knew that he would never walk again.

In I SCO the people of Western Pennsylvania were »hrovn info a panic by the proposal of i: stranger, claiming to be an 1 ura; 'an scientist, to «bool a white-hut boll into the bowels of the earth through an iron pipe driven to a great depth for the purpose. By the ignition of inflammable gases, thought to exist in the great cavities beneath the earth':» crust, the pro-iter expected to produce a si;flint explosion to lay bare the h ib-lervanean reservoirs m oil. The Pennsylvanian populace, instead of viewing this proposal uith the distrust and apathy traditional^ accorded the first efforts of inventive minds, possessed sufficient imagination to picture the possible results, and were so convinced that th»» scientist minimized rather than exaggerated the feasibility of his undertaking, that they selected a email but representative committee to bang him on the spot. Because he had conspired to disturb not only the peace but the actual foundations of society in Pennsylvania he was taken into custody and solemnly warned to desist. Less than a year afterward nitro glycerine was being exploded in large quantities deep down in the earth to shatter the rock and give an outlet to the oil without disturbance to the landscape.—Victor Ross In “Petroleum in Canada."

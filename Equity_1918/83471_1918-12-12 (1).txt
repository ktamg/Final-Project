Learning office work is like learning any other kind of work or trade or profession
Machinists are trained by practical machinists, doctors by doctors, dentists by dentists.
The secret of success of the Graduates of Willis College Is that they are the only ones trained by expert, experienced office workers for expert office work.
For Stenographer, Secretary or Accountant, we have the best courses available anywhere.
Last year our increase was 45%. This year to date is even better. Still Employ-^’Demands Exceed the Number of XV illib Graduates.

Ring Out, Wild Bella.
Rign out, ye bells! Proc’r m to nil the eafth,
That Tyranny is dead! ltlng out the birth Of endless peace. Clasp hands ncroes the sea, England, America. Let unity And love eternal tell That oil is well.
Ring out, ye bells of Franco and Italy!
Shout with your brazen tongues: “The world is free!” Great is the price you paid; great the reward,
Guide now the nlowshare. Sheathe your, valiant sword Let fruitful vineyards tell Thaf all is well.
Ye murdered Belgian bells your tongues are mute,
Rut high your hearts, your spirit resolute.
Call forth your trembling children from their caves, Show where their dauntless banner ever waves Triumphant. Let ft tell That all is well.

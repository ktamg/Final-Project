Sorry this pa|>er cannot enlighten them on that point.
TEXT OF PRESIDENT WILSON S REPLY TO THE GERMAN PEACE NOTE
borrow hundreds of millions of dollars—
Because Canada has put her hand the plow and will not turn back:—
—our country is in the war on the side of liberty and justice and will stay in it till complete victory is won and the unspeakable Hun is smashed and beaten to the ground;
—a nation at war must make tremendous expenditures in cash to keep up her armies and supply them with munitions, food and clothing;
—Canada must finance many millions of dollars of export trade in food, munitions and supplies which Britain and our allies must have on credit;
—for these purposes Canada must

meaning of the note of the imperial Chancellor,
“ Does the Imperial Chancellor mean that the 1 marial German Government accept the terms laid down by the President in his address to the Congress of the United States on the 8th of January last, and in subsequent addresses, and that its object in entering into discussions would be only to agree upon the practical details of their application ?
The President feels tround to say with regard to the suggestion of an armistice, that he would not feel at liberty to propose a cessation of arms to the Governments with which the Government of the United States is associated against the Central Powers so long as the armies of those (rowers are upon their soil The good faith of any discussion would manifestly depend upon the consent of the Central Powers immediately to withdraw their forces everywhere from invaded territory.
‘‘The President also feels that he is justified in asking whether the Imperial Chancellor is speaking merely for the constituted authorities of the empire who have mo far conducted the war. He deems the answer to these questions vital from every point of view.
“ Accept, sir, the renewed assurances of my high consideration.

The Canada Food Hoard h»< issued this statement : “As cereal substitute flours are now becoming available from the new crop, their use in the Canadian standard loaf will be increased shoitly to‘JO per cent, so that Canadian bread will conform to the “Allied Loaf' policy, as decided upon by the Food"Controllers of the respective countries.” Farmers’ wives, who are accustomed to bake their own bread, will not lie very enthusiastic over this order, as in truth they have not been over any F. fi. orders that have been doing violence to the flour bin. Talk as you like about economizing, but we run across a good many home bakers who say that since the use of flour substitutes has been forced upon them, there is more waste bread in their homes than ever before, although they are doing

TXT ANY storekeepers tend their business by taking advantage of the uses to which a motor truck can be put.
Those who use the horse and wagon for delivery are restricted to a limited area. But the merchant who owns a truck can cover many times the area possible by horse and wagon. He is able to increase his list of customers without interfering with the service he renders nearby customers. A rural delivery route can be added or lengthened. His loads can be increased. His service is improved while his costs are educed.

"This is an insult to a whole people which stings the pride of every Indian to the quick; it is a humiliation when no self-respecting people can be expected to tolerate; all classes in India unite in resenting it; the feudatory prinées, the great landowners, the gallant native officers of our Indian army, feel the insult as keenly as do the educated politicians. Indeed, few Englishmen, either in this country or overseas, can be satisfied with the situation. Common decency forbids our saying to the Indians.

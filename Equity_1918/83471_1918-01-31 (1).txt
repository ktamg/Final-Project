Learning office work is like learning any other kind of work or trade oi profession .
Machinists are trained by practical machinists, doctors by doctors, dentists by dentists.
The secret of success of the Graduates of Willis College Is that they are the only ones trained by expert, experienced office workeis for expert office work.
For Stenographer, Secretary or Accountant, we have the best courses available anywhere.
Last year our increase was 43% This year to date is even better. Still Employers' DeiuanIs Exceed the Number of Willis Graduates.

The "Nevei wafers*1 improved their status in the hockey world last Wednesday night, when they put it over the Star Ladies* team in the return match which was pulled off at the local rink on that occasion. But they required several minutes1 overtime hi which to break the tie, and so had nothing much to crow about. The night was very frosty, and so it is not surprising that sonic of the lady players took "cold feet” in the literal sense and were observed to bear evidences of that discomforting fact the next day.
The attendance, owing probably to the severe weather conditions, was not ns large as at the previous match, vet a tidy little sum was netted for Red Cross work.
After the match, players and officials partook of an inviting lunch at the Russell House.

Rural Schools.
There are many vacancies in our Protestant rural schools this winter, and already seventeen of these have been filled by students from the elementary class which was graduated at Christmas from the School for Teachers, Macdonald College.
These vacancies extend from Pontiac County to Gaspé, and are more numerous in English speaking counties than would be crcdit-
The new course leading to an elementary diploma has therefore been a success, as the students graduated at\Cbristmas started work at the New Year in schools which otherwise would have been left empty. Five vacancies have been filled along the Gaspé coast and others at Papineau ville, Calu-Frauklin Centre, South Box

His advice is to secure a re-pply of wood fuel, and lie Approves of the steps which some cities, towns and even villages have taken to accumulate a reserve. The matter is worthy of serious consideration by the citizens of Shawville and some are already devoting sonne thought to it. During the early part of the present winter not a little hard .ship and inconvenience was experienced by the non-arrival of coal which was ordered early in the summer. The stock of wood in the hands of farmers within seven or eight miles of the village was soon exhausted, the quantity being restricted to the non-ability of farmers to cut it, owing to the shortage of labor. Most of our citizens are now using this year’s cot which is likely to be exhausted before next Christmas for the sauie reason somewhat accentuated. Next year is likely to witness s diminisned supply and sequent increase in price. It would be well to consider if any measure of relief can be procured or devised before the stringency is felt, and we think it would be good municipal politics for the council to discuss the matter in conference with citizens interested. Someone may suggest a good way to meet the situation, Think it over anyway,	1

The revolutionary movement In Spain centers in the city of Barcelona. The goal of the revolutionists li a re-[ public, and republics stand for progress. Of all Spanish cities Barcelona Is the most progressive, writes Nlksha. For ten years the conservatives have been looking askance nt this great modern shipping and manufacturing center, so different from their sleepy Inland strongholds, and from the peasant villages of the quiet hills, with political Ideas of the Inst century.
Barcelona Is a great world city. It Is outdistancing Marseilles as the Commercial queen of the Medlterra nemo. The Spaniard has often been charged with a lack of business and enterprise. Barcelona la his answer. Here Ms factories rival those of Lancashire, his shipping that of Liverpool. The great industrial suburbs, each a city In Itself, are reminiscent of the outlying cities that cluster about Manchester In the industrial north of ' md.
Yet Barcelona remains characteristically Spanish. The city has taken

It Is a sunny town, with a clear, bracing air and n blue sky that the unoke of a thousand chimneys never hides. It has plenty of parka and tree shaded boulevards ; even Its poorer quarters lack the sordidness of the Anglo-Saxon slum. The flower markets, the promenades* the cafes, are thronged with loungers, not of the leisure classes, but workmen In their leisure time. The Spaniard has learned to work without forgetting ûow to idle. And withal, the crowds ire keen and wideawake, mightily In-:erested In public affairs, and discussing politics with the heat that Is a birthright In the Latin races.

PARTY IS SAFE IN LABRADOR
Newspaper correspondents advise os, says the Peoria Journal, that last fall ther appeared in the Washington, New York and Boston markets many barrels of plump little animals, all dressvd and skinned, which were sold as “marsh rabbits/*
It appears that for several weeks the good people bought these animals, rooked them according to the special directions and served them at family and party dinners ns “rabbits”—not realizing that this food was really Aomethlng vastly different from that )f the ordinary rabbit.
Then came the announcement that the “marsh rabbit** was nothing less than the muskrat.
All of which goes to show that even now the American people are not averse to being fooled. In fact, they like it. Barnum's statement holds true is it did when he displayed a sandpapered elephant as “the only sacred white elephant In captivity.*'

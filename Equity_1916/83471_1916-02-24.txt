Great Fish Harvest.
The Grand Trunk officials are delighted with the development of the Pacific Coast fisheries as shown in the report of the Fisheries Department of British Columbia, which reached Winnipeg recently. They point out with some pride that British Columbia fisheries contributed over 41 per cent, of the total fishery products of the Dominion, and that a great deal of this development has been due to the foundation, in the centre of the world's richest fisheries, of the City of Prince Rupert, and the opening of the G. T. P. transcontinental line which carries the halibut and other fish to eastern markets. The report states that In one month alone twenty-seven carloads of halibut were forwarded from Prince Rupert.
The halibut taken to British Columbia ports, and principally to Prince Rupert was valued at $1,734,200 while the herring catch biougbt $955,553 and cod $258,855. The report demonstrates how large has been t^e transfer of fishing vessels previously operating from Seattle and Ketchikan to the Canadian port of Prince Rupert where the operators now sell their catch, obtain halt and outfit for their firblng trips.

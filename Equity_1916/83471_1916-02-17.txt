To-day, however, the full skirt is one of the approved features of the modes, and is still growing fuller. We smile upon it approvingly now, and what, at its first appearance was looked upon as bulk and clumsiness, is now considered quaint and daintily feminine.
Ribbon As Trimming.
Ribbon is being used profusely ns I trimming on both hats and frocks. It ranges in width from the inch-wide faille or moire banding, girdling the waist of the severe little frock of taffeta or serge, or forming the perky cockade on the chic chapeau, to the wide satin, moire, or taffeta ribbon which forms the entire skirt or bodice of the dance frock or dinner dress. In many of the new dinner and evening dresses ribbon bows of all descriptions are used for trimming; there are perky little bows, wide, graceful bows, simple bows with flying ends tacked on to bodice, and skirt at various angles.

Use either milk or water to moisten. Drop into greased biscuit tins, allowing room to spread, and bake in a quick oven about 20 minutes. If mixed with milk less lard may be used.

The French have juat discovered the existence of a school for spies at Lorrach, in the Grand Duchy of Baden. There, in a sort of university for the formation of the perfect spy, spectacled herr professors initiated their pupils into the mysteries and artifices of espionage.
The University of Espionage of Lorrach admitted women, of course,
! as well as men. Before admission ! the candidate would be questioned by military officers, pretending to be police magistrates, who would decide whether the applicants possessed the necessary aptitude and inclination for the profession.

That the results o' the greater production campaign in Canada far exceed even the most sanguine hopes, is the statement mad»- in a report just
issued by the Commission of Conservation.
The idea has generally prevailed that greater production meant an in *n v’11 °,UI crease only in the wheat crop and ¦ g*r#ry other agricultural products, but lit
effects have been much more far-reaching. True. Canada harvested a wheat crop estimated at over 336,000,000 bushels, more than double that of the previous year, and 45 per cent, more than any previous w heat crop in her history. The dairy industry also sent from the port of _ Montreal butter and cheese valued at ’ $23,705,000.exceeding the exports ol 1914 by over $5,0<>v,000.
But the results in other industrie! were as striking, to quote the report : In mineral production Canada ha# ... i made numerous advances. Coppe?

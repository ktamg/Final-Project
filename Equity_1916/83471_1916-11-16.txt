H. W. Forster, and now Mr. Pike Pease. Mr. Pike Pease, who is the assistant Postmaster-General, lost hit son only a few days ago. Lieut. Ronald Pike Pease, who was in the Coldstream Guards, was only nineteen, and left Eton to take a commission.
He went to the front in May, 1916, and was promoted to first lieutenant in May of this year.

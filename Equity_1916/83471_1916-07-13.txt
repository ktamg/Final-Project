MAKES PEPFEti"
When the Blood Becomes Poor Disease Speedily Follows
COST OF FOOD IN GERMANY IS UP 85 PER CENT.

Every woman’s health Is peculiarly dependent upon the condition of her blood. How many women suiter with headache, pain in the back, poor appetite, weak digestion, a constant feeling of weariness, palpitation of the heart, shortness of breath, pallor and ner-vousnes. Of course all these symptoms may not be present—the more there are the worse the condition of the blood, and the more necessity that you should begin to enrich It without delay. Dr. Williams Pink Pills are beyond doubt the greatest blood-building tonic offered to the public today.
Every dose helps to make new, rich red blood, which goes to every part of the body and brings new health and strength to weak, despondent people.
Dr. Williams Pink Pills are valuable to all women, but they are particularly useful to girls of school age who become pale, languid and nervous. Thin blood during the growing years of a

Prof. Elnaudi, one of Italy’s most prominent economists, explains in the Corrlere della Sera of Milan the failure of Germany’s much admired organization intended to avert the shortage of food, as illustrated in what he calls the “tragicomic story of potatoes." . “If preparation in peace time and organization in war ¦ had been so economically efficacious in Germany," Prof. Elnaudi says, “then that country would have become a close market sufficient unto itself and prices of foodstuffs should have been cheaper there than elsewhere.

Whereupon Smith said:	"What?
Monsieur Dugas, you have furs to sell? Ah, that will ma ko Mr. If. sorry, very sorry to think that he should have lost his temper. What a pity!"
"Tene*," said Dugas, and he brought forth from his lodge a bundle of several very tine skins, i> one of which he threw over his arm, stroking it lovingly. That is the j best fox 1 ever trapped. This other is nearly as good. I said I would not sell them to the bourgeois, and I I won't. You are a young man, and ! perhaps you do not know the value. In Quebec 1 would get thirty pounds; but I do not wish to leave my family and go to Quebec. You may have them, and If your bourgeois says they are not worth thirty pounds you may send them back to me. I will not take the money now. Voila," and he pressed the bundle of skins upon the young trader.
The upshot was that he paid the sum of £23. all the money he had on him, and he and Dugas parted the best friends in the world. Dugas even accompanied him to the camp of the other trapper, and insisted on advancing the funds to pay for the latter’s small catch out of what he had himself received, the money to be returned at Mr. Smith's convenience.

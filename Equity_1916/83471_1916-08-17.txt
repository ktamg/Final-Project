When the Stomach to Out of Order the Whole System
Suffers.
Old Fashioned.
"They’re old-fashioned people."

"They still have fried potatoes and pork chops for breakfast.”
%
Indigestion is one of the most distressing maladies afflicting mankind.
When the stomach is unable to perform the work nature calls for, the result is severe pains after eating, nausea, heartburn, fluttering of the heart, sick headache, and often a loathing for food, though the sufferer Is really half starved. People with poor digestion, too, frequently try all sorts of experiments to aid the process of digestion, but there is only one way in which the trouble can actually be cured, that is through the blood. That is why the tonic treatment with Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills cures even the most obstinate cases of indigestion. They make rich, red blood that strengthens the stomach and the nerves, thus enabling It to do its work. The process is simple, but the result means good appetite and increased health and pleasure in life. In proof of these statements,
Mrs. Albert Hall, Sonya, Ont., says:
“I have used Dr. Williams' Pink Pills with wonderful results. For two years I was a great sufferer from indigestion, which almost made me a physical wreck. At times my sufferings were so great that I was unable to attend to my household duties. I had smothering spells at times and was afraid to lie down to rest. After every meal, no matter how sparingly I ate, I suffered great distress. I tried several doctors but their medicine was of no
avail. I saw Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills the British novelist, photographed just1 dorfs, Furstenbergs, Stinnes’s and the who as viceroy spent much

I lie testing department of the Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers of the French Republic made a highly scientific comparison between Ford constitutive material and the material used in another very noted and ex|>ensive In every test the Ford material proved superior.
The service given by Ford cars in Quebec has hilly substantiated the results obtained by these French scientist*.
Huy a Ford, not only because its first cost is les*, not alone lbecause its maintenance cost is less, but because its quality of service is greater,— because it gives more mileage |>er dull ir invested than any other make of car you can buy.
And it you want your Ford this summer, buy it today to ensure prompt delivery.

The 1916 Cray Dort sells for $850, yet it has the appearance and looks of a considerably more expensive car.
Electric starting, electric lighting, demountable rims, extra rim, gasoline gauge and speedometer on dash—and all those little conveniences that make motoring a pleasure are yours if you own a Gray Dort.
50-inch cantilever springs and a perfect distribution of weight make the Gray Dort one of the easiest riding cars on the market.
There is plenty of seat and leg room, too, in the 1916 Gray Dort, both in the driver's compartment and in the tonneau. You never feel cramped in a Gray Dort. In short, the 1916 Gray Dort is a car that satisfies every automobile desire at a price well within the reach of most families.
See the Gray Dort at our showrooms.

! This though was certainly uppermost in my mind (says a correspondent to the London Times) when I first passed through the gates of I Queen Mary’s Convalescent Auxiliary Hospital (for soldiers and sailors who have lost, their limbs in the war) at lioehampton, in the County of London; for I, too, had failed fully to recognize the wonderful progress of science, and had very little real conception of the rapid and marvellous strides which have been made in the creation of artificial limbs.
In the beautiful Roehampton House, generously lent for the purpose by Mr, Kenneth Wilson, with its peaceful grounds, our mutilated sailors and soldiers can obtain a new lease of life. They receive there the best possible artificial appliances and instruction in their use—an exceedingly important work, for In the past many a man has cast an artificial limb aside for the want of a little instruction as to its working.
There artificial • hands are taught to grip. The men learn to walk with their new legs as well as they ever

For some years he was Chancery “special.” “Specials” do not appear for a less fee than 100

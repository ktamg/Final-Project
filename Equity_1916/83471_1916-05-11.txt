In Krt'ttch Hospitals.
j The misery inllicted on heroic men when there is a shortage in the supplies at hospitals in France, was graphically told by Miss Elsie Mackenzie. before the members of the Secours National in Toronto recently. The speaker was stationed for sometime at a small ambulance hospital that had been an old schoolhouse.
Here French women who were not trained nurses worked voluntarily, but though untrained as we know the term they were natural nurses and soon had their patients well. The women at Dieppe gave every extra bed, .bedding, chairs, furniture of any kind that was necessary to furnish these small hospitals near there. They often went short of things themselves to provide for the needs l' the -v o in led i Idier ' ispital the) ! to powder fur fomentations, there was such a shortage of drugs and surgical supplies.

Having been unanimously chosen ns the standard-bearer ot the ( oiwrxative party of Pontiac, at a representative t onventioii livid at Campbells Bay on April 2lth,
I bei: to solicit \ oui votes and inlhieiive at the election for the Legislative Assembly ot this province which takes place on Monday, May £2nd.
In making this appeal for your support it is but fair to state that I am in favor ot the progressive, practical policy recently outlined Ivy our respected leader at Quebec, Mr. 1\ t on-mean. and if I am again intrusted xxitli your mandate I shall do my utmost to assist him m giving effet t to that policy, should lie be invested xxitli the reins
of government.
During the four year- I lvtd the honor of representing you in the Legislature of this Province, I saw much connected with the Lomu Administration that I, or no man claiming to be honest, and not blinded by partisanship, could approve of. The several scandals that have been partly unearthed, but denied investigation by Sir Lomer bonin and hi* supporters, are sutlirient. | am eon-x ineed. to wreck any Government, if the underlying facts could be got at.
( hie <>t the chief reasons tor springing on the election at thi- immpoi tune time, when farmers are busy and there i-diil reason foi it. i-. no doubt, to ward oil an enquiry into t he good i omb policy ami t he outlays connected tl xx itli. a* the! e is ample evidence to justify the belief that siieli and enquiry xxoultl re Veal that large sums of t lie people's money had been -«plundered in the operations of this go-called very poor progress made
During the short - impaign I shall endeavot t see a- many of the elector- a- possible ; but, gentlemen, you xx ill readily understand, in this huge county it xx ill be quite impossible to visit all. S,, I trust those whom 1 cannot find time to call on |x-i sonally xx ill accept the desire to do so for the ac t itself.

lUTtLFM.H’S PLOT.
How Knglisli Correspondent in Canada Sought to Release Prisoner».
A historic case, in which a plol hatched in Canada embarrassed the people of the neighboring republic, was the Philo Parsons affair, in which Bennett Burleigh, the famous war correspondent, played a leading part. Burleigh, in 1862, when a young man, went from Scotland, where be was born, to New York. From love of adventure he joined a sort of pirate company operating on the Chesapeake and Potomac Rivers, and was captured, but escaped from the prison at Philadelphia. Ho went to Detroit, and on September 18, 1864, he formed one of a company of Southerners plotting to seize the steamer Philo Parsons and proceeded to release the hundreds of Southern prisoners of w ar on Johnstone Island, off Sandusky, on Lake Frie. Burleigh boarded the boat at its Detroit wharf, and as the craft steamed to several Canadian ports other passengers got aboard, among them the other conspirators. all unsuspected. The next afternoon when the Philo Parsons had just pulled away from Kelly's Island the capture was made.
Burleigh held up the captain with a revolver, and a Confederate adventurer named Beal held up the man at the wheel. Then the conspirators— there were twenty of them—brought out arms they had taken aboard in a trunk, and away they sailed with crew and passengers as prisoners. The latter were landed at Middle Bass Island, and a small boat, the Island Queen, at the dock there was seised and scuttled. The Philo Parsons was then steered for the prison isle, where 2,500 Southerner» were kept. Spies had been sent ahead, and they were expected to arrange » way of entering the prison and looking after the crew of the United States gunboat Michigan, anchored there. The pirate crew watched with breathless anxiety for signals from their spies, but they didn't appear. So retreat was the only thing possible. The crew mutinied, too. but finally were got back to Canadian soli. The Philo Parsons was put out of business permanently, and the raid came to an Ignominious end. Beal escaped to the States. Burleigh was arrested and tried In Toronto. After a long fight his extradition was or* de red. and he was sent out ot the city carefully guarded. However, he was sent across the border on the understanding that he was to be tried only for Incendiarism, and as there was no direct evidence against him In connection with burning the Philo Parsons, be was kept In an Ohio prison until the public excitement bad partially died down, when he was allowed to escape.

They wanted to tend to it a lot. They even talked amputation, but my folks declared I might go through life on a crutch, but not on a peg.
Well,” said the general, “that leg has won a champion North American foot race. That leg has taken one stirrup for me, in riding more miles in the saddle than any other man in the world. In fact, I am so much better off than most men who never got hit with a big knife that I just had a curiosity to see what had happened to do me so much good!

Once he attempted n retaliatory practical joke upon the privileged favorite, whose i tongue had played a little too audaciously with the imperial dignity.
Balakireff had begged to be allowed to join the palace guard, and Peter, with apparent reluctance, allowed himself to be persuaded. He warned Rahikireff to take his duties seriously, and especially impressed upon him j that to be absent? from his post when summoned or to lose his a word would be on offence punishable with death.
Then he sent to the new officer's quarters a royal gift of extremely potent liquor “to moisten his commission." The jester, as his master had expected, partook of it too freely, and while he was sleeping off the effects the Czar stole into his room and carried away the new sword, leaving the scabbard, however, and the mock sword of lath that Balakireff always bore as part of his professional equipment us court fool.

The remarkable achievement of the English General, Townsheml, in with-i standing the siege of the Turkish army at Kut-el-Amara since early in December will ensure this insignificant town, which is situated on the east bank of the Tigris River, a conspicuous place in the geography of the world war when the history of the great struggle is written," says a bulletin of the National Geographical Society of Washington.
I "Before the English army was hemmed in at this unhealthy coaling station for steamers plying between the great date port of Basra and the important city of Bagdad, Kut-el-Amara, 100 miles south-east of the latter city, was nothing more or less than one of the myriad out-of-the-way places ‘to fortune and to fame unknown/

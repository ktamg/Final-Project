Joyce showed die of the sergeants waiting outside the room his blue form with the word “Rejected" scrawled across it ; and then, picking his way through the crowd of determined-looking waiting young men, ho reached the street.	|
As he stopped for a moment to light a cigarette, a girl on a bicycle came round the corner.
She was a pretty girl with coppery hair and big. wide-open hazel eyes, «uni the simple hoi land frock she wore suited her slim young form admirably.
"Hallo !" she called out gaily, catching sight of him. She slowed down, and jumped off her machine. "1 was Just wondering if I should come across you. Well, is it Private Iveslie Joyce now ?"
He raised his straw hat and took his cigarette out of his moutn.
“Well." he said hurriedly. "I've been up before the doctor, and- and they won't have me."
For some reason he averted his eyes. "What do you mean ?" asked the girl quickly surprised, surely you r aren't you ?"
She looked him over as she «spoke. To all outward appearance he was a perfectly healthy, well-built, strong young man. He was tall, finely set up, broad-shouldered, and. judging by Ills lean brown hands and sun tanned face.

44 My Deab Fbiends :
44 You will have heard long Wore this reaches you of the death of your dear one, in one of the big battles that has just closed. A good many of ourl gallant heme# fell and yours was amongst them. He was killed in action and died with him face to the foe.
44 These are dark days for many individual hearts, but in the night of death Hope sees a star and listening Love can hear the rustle of a wing, and out of the dark there are lieain* of light. First of all, he died in a great cause— the cause of righteousness, truth and final triumph was his side, ami for that cause he gave up hi# life.
44 And then again, he did not die as a coward, letting the issue go by default, but he died a hero, fighting fearful odds of shot and shell. He laid down his life. Jesus said 4 Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends/ Your loved one has actually done this very thing, really laid down his life for other*. . u believe he has fulfilled the Law of Love, I||| .1 am sure that Our Father will crown III bis valour and self warn fire in Einnmn- je m l Lind Je-us-aid ‘ In liy Father*- ™ house are many mansions, and Î am sure he ha# one.
“He was haded lovingly by the kind hand# of hi* comrades, and hi# spirit has gone to the home land. He died not alone, but with hundred* of hi*
I fellows, in one of the biggest tight* the Canadian# have ever lieen in Wore May our Father hies# and comfort and give you strength in this *ad hour.

well as the all-black and all-white hats.

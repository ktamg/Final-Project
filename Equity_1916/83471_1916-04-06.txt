An Impressive Service
Sunday evening’s Memorial Service to the memory of the lute Pte Dave lîudgin*, was attended by the largest congregation which ever before assembled within wall* of St. Paul’s Church.
The solemn event wa« looked forward to with an interdenominational interest, and when it warn announced by the pastor that the • cuing service in tin* Methodist Church would be cancelled in order to afford that large congregation an opportunity of attending ¦! memorial service, it was felt that the accommodation in St. Paul’s would be quite inadequate to meet the demand and so a large number of chairs were procured and with these every available bit of space in the building, including the cl cel, whs filled and occupied before the service began.
The sacred edifice was appropriately draped with the colors of Km pi re and the front scats on the left of the aisle were occupied by members of the deceased soldier’s family, including hi* two youthful soldier-sous, and also by a group of local recruits who have recently joined the Canadian force*.
The striking effect of the scene presented, the immense gathering and the impressiveness of the service throughout, was such as must sink deeply into the thoughts and memories of all who were privileged to attend.
The very able address of the Rector, Rural Dean Phillips, and also the well-chosen and appropriate remarks of the Rev. Mr. Tripp were listened to with keenest interest.

Timber is classed as hard or soft, and the main point of difference between the trees that produce these classes Is that the soft wooded tree has "needle leaves,” slim, narrow and almost uniform in breadth, while the hard wood trees have broad leaves of various sbai»ea. Again, some soft wood trees carry cones, such trees being termed conifers. Resin, too, Is more characteristic of soft than of hard wood. To the class of soft woods

“Will the United States always be at peace with the rest of the world?"
“Always means forever. I can't fill your order as a prophet*. All I dare to say is that the United States is in no danger now of invasion, nor will it be in immediate danger after the war in Europe is over.
“In my opinion, there will be no wars in the near future.
“Moreover, great changes are bo occur in Europe. The people will be sick of war, and the men who expected to die when there is will take action to protect themselves, their homes, and their families. William of Germany is the last of his house bo sit upon a throne.

Money In Turkeys.
For those who are favorably situated for raising turkeys a more profitable side line can hardly be found. Given plenty of range where the turkeys can find grass hoppers and other insects, green vegetation, the seeds of weeds and grasses, waste grain, acorns and nuts of various kinds, the cost of raising them is very small and the profits large.	u
Grain and stock farms are particularly adapted to turkey raising, and it is on such farms that most of the turkeys are found. Little has ever been done in the way of raising turkeys in confinement, and where it has been tried the results have been discouraging. Plenty of range is essential to success in turkey raising.
In selecting turkeys for breeding, the most important factors to be considered are vigor, size, shape, bone, early maturity and color of plumage. The body should be deep and wide, the back broad and the breast round and full. The head should be of good size and of a clean, healthy

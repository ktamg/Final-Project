Culture.
Culture is a slow process. It comes from long and close contacts. It Is the fruit of reflection, of travail of soul and of mind. Grappling with something until the very essence of It has been extracted is a first step. Thus the tastes of essences Is learned, and once learned lesser distillations do not satisfy. Then follows a growing power to discriminate, to distinguish nice values, to Judge of quality, to answer to beauty, to feel the need, that what you have, though It may be little, may still be the real thing. This Is culture. It is not baggage, like diplomas and degrees. It la not things seen and heard, miles traveled or books read. These are the materials for culture. They contribute to It only when they are absorbed by the mind and as really Municipality ot ( Dremhm. lost in It ns water and lime, phosphates

There have been so many bloody Upper Ottawa Improvement battles it is perhaps Impossible to say
with absolute certainty which of them all was the bloodiest, but the balance of the evidence seems to be In favor of the battle of Chalons, France, fought A. D. 451 between the IT uns, under Attila, and the Romans. Gotha and Franks, under the command of Aetius, the most renowned captain of 1 his day. At the head of his 000,000 savages Attila was having everything his own way, and it looked as if Aryan civilization was destined to fall before the Tartar despotism, when suddenly, like a bolt out of the blue, Aetius fell upon the barbaric hordes and Europe wns saved.

One of the strangest romances of the great war has just come to light in Leeds.
Ten years ago a Leeds youth, George Ernest Oldroyd, disappeared from his home, and when his parents next had news of him he was acting as a cook to a party of Canadian railway engineers on the prairies of Canada

August. 1914, and again in August,

The prisoners of war whom Canada is holding most securely are 270 Germans in Fort Henry, an old stone fortification on a hilltop overlooking the harbor of Kingston, Ontario.
Some were commiserating over their first anniversary when I visited them on Sunday. August 22.
The curse of Fort Henry is lack of facilities to afford healthful work for the interned. As many as can be used are engaged in rebuilding the old walls; others do the cooking, washing, cobbling, and general work, for which they are allowed wages of 26 cents a day. against 11 cents paid by Germany to Canadians working in
her prison camps. I beard bitter pro- root recently met there a member of test by one or two prisoners that ! !

You can see their beauty face to face.
When those shining ones each ing take

The mountain tops are tinged with gold

Of Beauty that's hid away, away,
Only revealed by the light of day.

And the walls are high ami bleak and bold,;
Down in the valley the river flows,
Fed from above by the mountain snows.

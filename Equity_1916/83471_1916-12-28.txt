Tennyson's Father Had to Fly For Hie I	Life From Rueala.
Shortly after the assassination of Emperor Paul of Russia, Tennyson, the father of the poet, dined with Lord St Helens, the British ambassador, In Moscow. Several Russian officers of high rank whose names he did not <00w were also guests. During dinner 1 guarded reference was made to the MDperor’g death.
“Why do you speak so gingerly lbout a matter so notorious?" cried Tennyson Impulsively, leaning across jls neighbor, a Russian whose breast was covered with orders. “We know rery well in England that the Emperor Paul was murdered. Count Zoboff mocked him down, and Rennlngsen ind Count Pa bien strangled him!"

Early arrivals in this camp had fumed and fussed at the ill luck that made them prisoners of war when their fellows were driving along to certain victory. This spirit of confidence has received harsh blows in the course of two years as hatches of prisoners arrived with dims couraging tales of checked progress and steps of retrogression. They were to hear sad tidings from the “
Somme. A nerve-racked, disheartened group of captives, dusty and torn of raiment, was ushered grounds.

I When the first passenger railroad ||| ever built was opened In England In ! 1825 the train traveled from one end of the line to the other, a distance of twelve miles, in two hours. And Wood, one of the best known writers on the subject of railroads at that day, wrote as follows:
“Nothing can do more harm to the adoption of railways than the promulgation of such nonsense as that we shall see locomotives traveling at the rate of twelve miles an hour.”
Today, with locomotives traveling at the rate of seventy-five miles an hoar, one can look at Wood's warning with n feeling of amusement.
In 1829 a locomotive was introduced In this country, and In the following year Peter Cooper experimented with a locomotive on the D nnd 0. railroad. 1

Double Stars.
A double star is one which consists of two stars lying close together and revolving In nu orbit. For some time Professor Comstock, astronomer of the University of Wisconsin, has made a particular study of this feature In the boa vous.
A new phenomenon Is n double star which he noticed was that two bright stars “wobbled" and did not have the usual steady appearance. At length the conclusion was reached that this condition was caused by a dark star in close proximity to the two bright stars. Such a situation was considered Impossible at first, hut analysis revealed that the two bright stars could thus exist with a dark star without breaking down. A1 hough the dark star has never been seen, there Is sufficient proof to Justify the belief that It Is the cause of this double star’s peculiar behavior. It revolves about the double star about once In a little less than twelve years.

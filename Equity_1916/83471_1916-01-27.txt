Ask those who have had la grippe regarding thes present condition of their health and most of them will answer “Since I had the grip I have never been well,” There is a persistent weakness of the limbs, bad digestion, shortness of breath and palpitation of the heart caused by the thin-blooded condition in which grip almost always leaves its victims after the fever and influenza have subsided. They are at the mercy of relapses and complications, often very serious. This condition will continue until the blood is built up again, and for this purpose nothing can equal a fair treatment with Dr. Williams’

Russian models, the smart flared coats and skirt, and for the strictly correct sport suit along the Norfolk lines combined with an equally severe skirt.
The New ( ape Appears. Among the new features which, of course, are but u revival of the old, is the rape. This appears upon all types of frocks and suits in the form of the shoulder rape, sleeve cape, and cape collar. The full-skirted, simple-hod iced frock of taffeta, worn at an afternoon tea, the skating rink, or the concert, displays its cape, collar, or series of collars, when it is not featuring a Puritan-like shoulder drapery, crossing surplice-fashion in front, anil held in place in back by a girdle, from below which tiny coot tails or tabs appear. There is some indication too, of thu rape returning us a separate wrap; in fart pelerines of quaintly quilled taffeta, are being shown to wear over light summer frocks and are now being worn in the south. Many of these display the unfitted, rather bunchy-looking collar which accentuates the slope of the shoulders thereby living up to one of the chief requirements of the present ; modes. Many circular and Directoire capes matching the hat arc among the season's attractive fancies.

Kaiser May Die.
The chief points of Gabriel Neith's forecast are as follows;—
War probably will continue until 1916. although March, 11)16, bring strong hopes of pence.
Am the sub-cycle of Mars continues until 1944, this will not be the last conflict of the nations of the world.
Minch and June will ho memorable months in the United States because ! of internal troubles ns well ns external dangers.
Germany may suffer adverse conditions in January and March. Death of a person of rank, possibly a member of the royal family, is indicated.
Air Raids nn England.
England should expect peril from air raids from February 3 to February 7. Personal danger for tlio King or one of his sons in March.
Italy has a forecast of alternate victories and reverses. Trouble lor a

President Wilson has the augury that 1016 will be the most active year of his life. New international problems will multiply, political treachery may be revealed.
Halley's Comet Blamed.
The astrologers point out that ever since the return of Halley’s Comet in i 1910 wars and disasters have fallen upon Europe. This is what their “science" would lead us to expect, as the appearance of the great comet in Aries was said by ancient astrologers to presignify “evil and detriment to the Eastern part; sorrows to the peoples under Aries; the clash of arms and bloodshed; death or dethronement of some king." Since the comet appeared two local wars have occurred in the Balkans, Italy has been at war with Turkey, King Edward VII., the leading monarch of Europe, has died, and now the greatest war of all time is raging.
The astrologers assert that they gain their foreknowledge of coming events by studying the heavens from many different points of view. The position of the sun with regard to the planets and stars is the most important heavenly influence on human actions and earthly occurrences. The position of the moon, owing to its nearness to us, and the important gravitational influence it exerts upon our minds and bodies, is next in importance.

Seer’s Gloomy View.
In January, we are told, there will ' he n great disaster to English shipping. A great strike will nearly cripple England. We may expect ! serions reverses and a terrible blow.
An attempt on the life of the King of England is foretold. To make up for the misfortunes of England, the French army will win a great victory.
Among the almanacs compiled by loading prophets and astrologers are i those of Prof. Zadkiel, Prof. Raphael and “Old Moore” of London. The , I'snal annual published by Madame de Thebes of Paris is delayed. Mme. de i Thebes, however, is uttering prophecies concerning the future in her usual picturesque and impressive are: , manner.




Upset for British Government.
Other predictions of the astrologers
:
_________>
Sensational divorce case in British aristocracy.
Serious financial panic in New York, London and other financial I centres.
British Government to be upset in October.
Revolutions in Spain and Hungary in November. Hungary to grain independence.
Austrian empire will be completely wrecked.
Attempt will be made to assassinate Alphonse of Spain.
Pirates to commit many outrages on coast of China.
Serious rioting in Rome during the winter.
Widespread epidemic of disease in Prussia.
The Fashions
Remarkable Prediction.
Perhaps the most remarkable and definite prediction regarding the war is that it will come to an end on . May 22. Prof. Raphael says that “the ! passage of Jupiter to Aries and his j trine aspect to the planet Mars is a i strong indication of success to the arms of the allies in April.”
One prophet finds that the heavens foreshadow either ill-health, accident or trouble for General Joffre, from May to July. This is apparently the astrologer’s way of predicting that the victorious general will pass away not later than July.

Cakes That Keep.
There is always demand for cakes that keep—that can be kept in the cake Iwx for a week or two, ready to furnish savory slices for afternoon tea or the glass of lemonade offered to a guest on a warm «lay or to add to the luncheon dessert if need be. Here are the recipes for some very good cakes that can be relied on for freshness for a good many day*.
Pork Cake.—This is an old recipe for a very good cake and it Is rather odd that it is not made often nowadays, for it is not very difficult to prepare. It will keep for a year, and there are stories of old-time housekeepers who uacd to make next year’s pork cakes on the day when they began to cat those made last year. The recipe for this cake calls for a pound of salt pork chopped fine. Pour a pint of boiling water over this and add two cupfuls of molasses and two of sugar, sifted with a teaspoonful of cinnamon and half a teaspoonful each of cloves and nutmeg, Then add eight cupfuls of pastry flour and a pound of seeded raisins, threequartera of a pound of currants and a quarter of a pound of citron, shredded, all the f tire dredged with some of the flour.

The Difference Between the Lift Pump and the Force Pump— Intereating and Instructive Facts By An Expert.
During the war in the Sudan in l8H4-f>, Lord Charles Hereaford took the steamer Safieh up the Nile to the rescue of Sir Charles Wilson’s party, which was isolated in a hostile country between the strong force at Wadi Habeshi and the Muhdi'e host marching down from Khartum. The expedition was once in great peril through an accident to the ship’s boiler. The skill and courage of its engineer officers saved the ship, however, as Lord charles tells in his interesting “Memoirs”:

Abdul Hamid, they dragged a man of 65 from a palace where he had been all his life scarcely more than a prisoner. In years of inactivity his body had grown big, big with width, breadth and length, a burden for his short legs. He was a sick man then.
On the semlik Fridays the chalky paleness of his heavy face and the dullness of his eyes were accentuated by the troops of young guardsmen in brilliant uniforms and the officers in glittering gold braid who surrounded him. The picture had in it more of pathos than imperialism.

The Sufit-h had passed the fort at Wadi Habcshi, when a great cloud of steam or smoke rose from the after hatchway. Instantly the rifle fire of the enemy increased. Chief engineer Ben bow ran to the engine room, A Maltese carpenter ran up to me, crying, "All is lost, sare, myself and my brother, sa re! The ship he sink, saie I” I promptly kicked him out of the way.
The black stokers came rushing up from the stokehold hatchway. I did not know whether the ship was on fire or the boiler injured ; but as the ship still had way upon her, I ordered her to be headed toward the bank.
Mr. Benbow soon reported that the boiler was pierced by a shot, that the shot had entered above the water line, and that the vessel was safe.
In the meantime the two engine-room artificers had been carried up from the engine room so terribly scalded that the flesh of their hands, fore-arms and faces was hanging in strips. They had been stationed by Mr. Benbow between the boiler and the ship's side, with orders to insert shot plugs if the sides were pierced. In that position they were further from the exit than the Sudanese stokers, and therefore were more severely injured.
I asked Mr. Benbow if he could repair the boiler, and he replied, "I think I can do it.”
Mr. Benbow, assisted by the leading stoker, drew the fires and pumped out the boiler. He found a hole some three inches in diameter, round which the plate had bulged inward. Mr. Benbow then set to work to make a new plate with his own hands. With no other assistance than that of the

boiler plate corresponding to the first, and cut the threads of the screws on bolts and nuts. Since the new plate was too thin to take the boiler pressure, he had also to bolt a new iron bar across it, drilling the holes through the injured boiler plate. During the whole time he was below in the stifling-hot engine room at work upon a task demanding at once great exertion and the utmost nicety, the fire from the fort never ceased. Bullets pattered continually on the hull; some of them pierced it and struck the wounded men who lay below. At any moment another shell might burst into the engine room; but Mr. Benbow went on with his work.

THE UBIQUITOUS TURKEY.
He Has Spread All Over the World Despite His Retiring Ways.
In every corner uf the globe almost, nt least where civilization has spread its epicurean taste, may be found the domesticated turkey-not, however, of his own volition. Never would he, In his wild state, have sought to cross the stormy seas to find green fields and pastures new.
He is not so constructed. He is not bold or adventurous of disposition. On tbe contrary, he Is timid and much afraid of things he does not understand and when undisturbed Is prone to let well enough alone and get along with his accustomed feeding grounds.
Again, as a filer the turkey is not a ml pronounced success. lie files ponderously, almost painfully and with great effort and only when very much frightened. Ills flight can be sustained for only a short distance, but wbat the wild turkey lacks as an aviator be

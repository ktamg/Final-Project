The gold reserve in the Bank of England at the present time is estimated at about $26f>,000,000. There are other gold reserves, of course, in the hands of other joint stock banks. One of the aims of the Government is to prevent sovereigns going out of the country to keep up the reserve gold supply and to prevent the gold from reaching the enemy.
For the past six months, or even since the munition workers began to work night and day and draw greatly increased wages, they have been having gold coins melted for jewelry. The practice is said to have become especially noticeable in Birmingham, where many of the large jewelry manufacturers are located. There is no

Color Cmnhinalions.
Blue serge naturally takes to black blue faille combines effectively with b!ui k, many shades of grey, the greenish, coper y tones, orange, terra-cotta and similar shades. These dark combinations of course are correct for the street: for the indoor dress or afternoon gown, one may allow the color fancy a little freer rein. There are some wonderfully vivid touches of color brought in now and then in a sombre frock, quite transforming it. As a general rule, however, pale tones will predominate this season. Thi« is owing to the present condition of the dye market; naturally pastel colored fabrics require much less dye than deep shades. It is most timely that this should happen in the Summer season when we are all of us in-chned toward white, pale pinks, blues, mauves, and lavenders which are so particularly fascinating this season. By Fall, if the war is not at an end, perhaps we shall all take to white,

law against the practice of melting Government moneys.
Hume Williams, a member of Par* linment from Nottingham, who thinks the Government should make it a crime to melt sovereigns down to make jewelry, said:
“As the law now stands a man can hike a five-pound note to the Bank of England and demand sovereigns for it. He can take the gold coins to his factory, melt them down, mix the gold with certain other metals and make jewelry. The mere squandering of the munition workers' money in this way, in a time of national stress, when the surplus is needed for silver bullets and for a support for the worker and his family in possible days of need to come, is a bad thing.
“There is another serious side to it. The State spends money in converting bar gold into sovereigns, and anybody can go along and get the sovereigns and melt t*hem again. Also, if a man wants to take golden sovereigns to Germany he cannot do so, as there is an embargo against taking sovereigns out of this country. There is no regulation, however, against his taking gold in dbhvr forms.
“Therefore, if a man wants to supply Germany with British gold he can take notes to the Bank of England, get sovereigns for them, melt, them down and take t*he gold, say, to Holland and then get it into Germany. As our gold reserve in comparison with that of Germany is small, it becomes a serious matter to allow this golden drain."

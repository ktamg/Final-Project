The lecture given by the Rev. XV. .1. Com»ly in the Mvthodi-t C hurch, last Friday evening, on “The Development of Christianity in the North Went, * was of a very interesting nature, and it -eem* rather unfortunate that the condition of both weather and roads was responsible for keeping many away, as the lecturer, having resided in Alberta for a number of year*, was in a |x)*ition to give a lot of information about the country, it* early settlement, it-pioneer *tniggle* and it* progrès*, both matei ially and spiritually.
A city man, familiar with life in the country, uses the “wood-died test ’ to determine whether it i~ safe to lend a farmer money. If lie finds a g< rod ftock of wood oil hand, with plenty of it split and neatly piled, and some split very fine, so that it w ill kindle easily, he conclude* that the man is f<>rc-handed, look-* out for his wife * comfoi t, does not *|)ciit hi* rainy days at the store, and i* a good
If the wood died shows shiftlessne»*, he iff uses to lend.
There waf an amusing incident last week, say* the Marmora Herald. One of the boy#* went home to his billet. He had been to a celebration and bad indulged a little. It|h>ii his arrival home lie started to prepare for bed. lie carefully twk off one puttee and then quit, and after a while he couldn t tell for the life of him w hether he was going to bed or getting up. He started to dress again, but looking at the clock he saw his mistake and went to bed. In the morning he had a great hunt for one puttee ami after a long search he discovered it. He Imd put it on the wrong leg—the leg of the table.

A Large Meeting
There was a large attendance at the Patriotic meeting livid in the lecture room of the Methodist Church, last Wednesday evening, under tin* direction of (apt. Carter and other officers of the 130th Battalion, who have been on a reel iiitmg mission here and at other Pontiac centres for several weeks |»a*t.
The meeting xvn* held with the object of placing the wac situation clearly before people who thus far have been regarding this vital question somewhat indifferently ; to show the need of sending more men to the tank*, md to stimulate a patriotic sentiment among y men which would prompt them to enlist in the Empire's service.
The Rev. Mr. Tripp presided and short addresses were made by some of the local clergymen, the chief speaker of the evening, however, being the Rev. .In* A. Elliott, Chaplain of the 13ffth,and, by the way. an old Clarendon boy. ('apt. Elliott discussed the recruiting issue from various angles, and made out a pretty strong show that thone wh<? • wild should enlist instead of allowing others to fight their battles.
Capt. Carter also made a very interesting address, in which he touched on the circumstances that brought on the war, and dealt with the aims and objects which Germany had in view in preparing for it on such a stupendous sea lathe commercial and jmlitieal domination of the world. The Allies had set themselves to the task of crushing out the military spirit of Germany, which threatened the liberty of the world and it was the duty of every mail who prized the free institutions he enjoyed, to assist in the fight with all his energies.
Patriotic selections were rendered by Miss Pearl McDowell, and the meeting closed with the National Anthem.

The largest jreballs, however, penetrate deeper ind may reach the earth or explode aot far above it
Dr. Wegener finds that the meteors last that penetrate deep enough pass through three color stages—viz. yellow-white, green and deep red. The great

Thrill of Being Wet.

Even the ' tedium of being rubbed with alcohol, bundled op and warned you would catch your death did not diminish the event You voted It better than the time you fell off the boat dock It lasted longer.—Atlantic.
Criticism Implied.

CLOUD FORMATIONS.
ua, once extended over 400,000 square Hiles of territory In Asia Minor and Syria. A few years ago practically nothing was known of the life and civ-
Clouds consist of particles of con ' jiizatlon of these mysterious people. Jenved water vapor and In some cases i j^ey nre mentioned In the Bible and >f extremely fine spicules of Ice, which n tbc Egyptian and Assyrian records, s also formed from water vapor. Wa- but untn very recently their own story er vapor which arises by evaporation bfl(1 never been read by modern man. .Tom the surface of seas, ’ukes, etc., roday thanks to the excavations that s lighter than dry air at the same | ^-ere carried on at the capital city of emperature and pressure. It Is also
nvlsible.
It disseminates Itself through the itmosphore aud ascends to great lelghts. There, owing to the fall of temperatures and to other causes, it begins to condense Into particles which ire slightly heavier than air and which jecome visible clouds.
Owing to the Influence of winds and of rising currents as well as to the fact that the condensed particles are searly as light as air the clouds remain floating, like flue suspended matter In water, until further condensation creates particles of sufficient size to form raindrops, whose relative great weight brings them rapidly to the ground. .
That clouds do slowly descend even when not condensed into rain may be observed when they nre seen to dissolve and disappear without apparent ?ause. This is caused by the cloud's iescent to a level where a rise of temperature causes the condensed water vapor to revolatilize, thus becoming igain Invisible.

Scientist Who Couldn’t Light a Fire.
Lord Kelvin, like Lord Morley, once amused n Scottish audience with a display of Ignorance. At a lecture in Edinburgh, with Lord Kelvin In the chair, the Duke of Argyll was taken suddenly 111. “When the aged peer was carried down to one of the anterooms," said a local paper, “one of the first things to be thought of was the lighting of a fire, nnd this task was tackled by the duke's host. Lord Kelvin. But Instead of placing some paper In the grate nnd some wood on that In the orthodox manner, he amazed the onlookers by desperate efforts to kindle a handful of sticks at n gas burner. Ordinary mortals may be pardoned for taking some satisfaction In the fact that even so great a philosopher as Lord Kelvin did not know bvw to light a fire."

THE FRIENDLY ENEMY
When it was first decided by the Kaiser and some of his closest advisers that an attack on Verdun, undertaken by methods which had proved successful in Russia and in Serbia, would be successful, the co-opcration of Field Marshals Von Hindenburg and Von Mackensen was sought.
Berlin War Council
For this purpose they were summoned to Berlin, where they were met by the Kaiser, the Crown Princes of Germany, Bavaria and Wucrttem-berg, and Generals Von Haeseler and Von Deimling. When the matter was laid before them, both the great German loaders, who had proved their worth in the eastern field of the war, opposed a grand assault on the French stronghold, and explained the radical difference between conditions on that front and those which had made success possible in other regions.	'
As both field marshals had already objected to taking part in the operations in France and Flanders unless they had an entirely free hand and complete liberty from interference on the part of the Crown Prince, it

In the old days the successful sailoi reaped Ills own reward. He took a large share aof the value of the prizes he captured, and ou one occasion there was some unpleasantness between Queen Elizabeth and Dartmouth be cause It was thought she took more than her share.
Spoils were divided in certain qro-portions, the comander taking the lion's share, though each man received his quota. And very rich were some of these prizes, w hen it Is remembered French, 7; that great galleons were continually
employed carrying gold, precious stones, and valuable merchandise from Spanish colonies to the motherland, such as the rich ship that sailed from Manilla to Acapulco, and was ouce captured by Anson.

Golf Defined.
On the terrace of a country club a group of nongolfers were taking tea.
A male nongolfer said thoughtfully:
“Golf might be defined as billiards gone to grass.”
“Spleen on the green. I'd call It," «aid a female nongolfer.
“Or the last flicker In the dying fire of athletic*." sneered a young football player.
“The misuse of land and language," suggested a tennis champion.
“No. no; you're all wrong." said a famous angler. “Golf Is simply a game * herein the ball lies badly and the player well.”

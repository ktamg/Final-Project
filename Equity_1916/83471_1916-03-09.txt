A Scandinavian correspondent of the London Times writes: “I recently had n visit from an old university friend, belonging to a neutral country, who has lived in Germany since the begining of the war, has associated with well infotmed industrial circles, and consequently has acquired some inside knowledge. According to him, the most striking fact is the change of tone which has taken place in Germany.

Many university men who signed the various mad declarations about German innocence and British perfidy at the beginning of the war now feel positively Ashamed. They excuse their foolishness in putting their names to thorn by Buying that they did not know the exact wording.

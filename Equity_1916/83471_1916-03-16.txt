Although Marshal Blucher held his position at Sambrc, he was much weakened by the severity of the contest, and General Bulo not having yet arrived, he retired under cover of the night upon Wauve, and I retired from the farm of Less Quatre Bras upon Zenape, and thence to Waterloo, by the next* morning at ten o’clock. The enemy did not pursue Marshal Blucher, nor the troops under my command. On the following day, except a body of cavalry upon the right of the Earl of Uxbridge his Lordship charged them with the First Life Guards upon which the enemy retired. The troops under my command took up their position, the right on Merke Braine ravine, and the left to the Heights of Hamlet of Terre La Haye.

Is it nut possible to take the piece of shoulder chuck and cook it some other way than unending pot roast? It could be seasoned with dressing and served with a tomato instead of of a brown sauce. In the matter of soups, many of us go on in the same unvarying way of vegetable bouillon and tomato bisque. How about all the other purees, green dried peas, yellow split peas, onions, carrots? Him about the many kinds of soups with meat bulls or noodles? There is not a foreign nation but excels us in the variety of its soups. So, too, with potatoes. Why always the same mashed, boiled or creamed? Under the hands of a competent cook they become tasteful, varied and really interesting. Cheese, brown stock, lemon juice, all these can be added to potatoes, and there is even a book on 101 different kinds of potatoes.
No one thing will make for greater economy in our cooking than greater variety. Instead of the steak that we think must always be broiled we can use a “skirt steak," or flank, and have a delicious casserole dish at half the price. Instead of the soup that uses expensive vegetables, we can have a simple stock or puree fur less money. Instead of a dessert needing three

Four English menservanfa in the German Royal Household were interned in Germany a week after the outbreak of war.
Lieut, von Tirpitz, son of the German admiral, who is a prisoner of war in England, is the beat lawn-tennis player in the German Navy.
One of the boasts of Dr. Von Beth-mann-Hollwcg, the German Chancellor, is that he has never had bo pay a visit to a dentist since he was fourteen.
Autographed photographs of the Czar and Czarina were sold at a pri-1 vale auction in Petrograd for $2,500 each. The proceeds went to a war charity.
The Prince of Wales a little while ago had a pipe knocked out of his mouth by a flying fragment of a shell that burst within thirty yards of his Royal Highness.
The titles held by Lord Stamford-ham and Lord Ribblesdale will become extinct owing bo their heirs having been killed in the war, unless they are granted “special remainders” by the King, as was done in the cases of Lord Roberts and Lord Wolseley.

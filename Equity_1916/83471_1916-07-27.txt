The patrol consisted of four members of the force, two Indians, with
Besides food I and equipment, the patrol carried 30 pounds of mail for Fort McPherson j and Horse hell Islands.
"We met,” says the report, "one , band of Indians at the foot of the Cariboo Born Mountains, who were In poor circumstances, having no provisions whatever. They were making their way south to the Wind River to hunt caribou. We passed three families living in cabins on the Peel River. These people were living entirely on rabbits.”
The weather is described as good, although during the last ten days of the trip the mercury stood from forty to fifty degrees below zero.
Many caribou were seen; five were shot, two being used and three cached in the snow for the use of the return patrol. They also cached for the same purpose one hundred and fifty pounds of dried meat, five pounds of tea, eight pounds of tobacco, three hundred pounds of dried fish, some flour, bacon, and beans.
The diary of the patrol closes with the arrival at Fort McPherson—"all men In good shape, and dogs In first-class condition."
The return patrol made the journey In seventeen days, the greater speed being due to milder weather and a better trail. A band of Indians was met, and as they had just killed twelve caribou, they were in plenty. Here one comes upon an effect of the war. "None of the Indians are trapping fur," states the North announced that the 1 report. "This Is due to the extreme-
winter patrol of the Royal ly low prices being paid for pelts."
I The Eskimo chief with the long name does not dwell along this trail.
I The home of his people Is on the n the Yukon, from Fort McPherson on shores of the Arctic near Herschell
unty the Peel River, near the mouth of Island, and the money he contributed was likely received for work performed or supplies of some kind furnished the whalers who make Herschell Island their base.

More Canadian Wood Veed.
That some 5,570,851 feet of Canadian timber have been used in connection with work at Port Nelson, as compared with 4,559.637 feet of United States timber, was the statement made by Hon. Dr Reid In the House of Commons recently. The American wood used was long leaf rellow pine, oak, hard pine, and Oregon pine. That the cost of transporting freight to Port Nelson has been reduced to one-fifth what It was orlg-nally was also shown. In 191Î the iverage cost of freight per ton to the r>ort was $56.66; In 1914 It had been reduced to $13 39, and now It Is only 19.62. with a direct lightering •barge of $2.56 per ton nt Port Nel-

crater.”
The operator shows five minutes in the life of a company of mud-bespattered Connaught Rangers. First one sees the Irishmen hugging the dripping wall of the trench with fixed bayonets waiting for the mine to bs sprurtg. There is a spout of black earth a little way off it in the desolate fields, and at once the Rangers tumble out and walk, rather than run, through the sticky mess toward the crater.
The camera man evidently went with them, for he was there when the Rangers took possession of the hole, and he filmed the hand grenade throwing that followed. The soldiers remind one of workers busy with risky blasting operations in a railway cutting concentrated on a shift of toil that has nothing to do with fighting man to man. This la as near fighting the Germans as the camera has got as yet, and short of a bayonet attack it is as near as anything we are likely

Owing to the extreme cost of all the high class paints, we have put in a heavy stock of “ OTTAWA PEERLESS PAINTS.” We have handled this line for the past three years and it gives excellent satisfaction, in fact we believe the Floor Paint is equal to any other make on the market.

LET US PRODUCE AND SAVE—
The war is now turning on a contest of all forces and resources men, munitions, food, money, call to all is to produce more and more. It may he necessary to work harder. The place of those who enlist must be taken by those at home, men and women, old and young. The more wc produce the more we ran save. Produce more on the farms and in the gardens. Save more and help to w in the war.
LET US NOT WASTE MATERIALS—
Begin at home. The larger portion of salaries and wages is spent on the home - food, fuel, light, clothing. Are any of these things being wasted 7 $20.00 a year saved from waste in every home in Canada will more than pay the interest on a war debt of $500.000.000.

The "truce of God" was Introduced Oy the clergy of Guienne around about ;he year 103Ô. It was adopted In Spain lbout 3000, In England about 1080. According to this famous treaty, a cessation of all violent quarrels was en-loined under heavy penalties during all :hurch festivals and from every Wednesday evening until the fullow-ng Monday morning. This left only ¦ bout eighty days in the year available for shooting and stabbing one’s neighbors.
The truce seems to have accomplished much good, notwithstanding the fact that It was very imperfectly observed.-

Swans For the Table.
The swaa as a dinner dish has been seen on English tables within comparatively recent times "Up till a century or so ago," according to F. W. Hack-wood, "swans were prepared for the table in and around Norwich The young birds were put up to fatten In August, given as much barley as they would eat, and by November they were In prime condition. If kept longer they began to fall off, losing flesh and fat and the meat becoming darker In color. The corporation of Norwich still maintains Its ancient swannery at St Helen’s swan pit and sells off a few of the fatted birds every Christmas at 2 guineas each."—London Chronicle.

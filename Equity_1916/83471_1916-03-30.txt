Ur. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale I people are an all year round tonic, I blood-builder and nerve restorer. But I they are especially valuable in the I spring when the system is loaded with L impurities as a result of the indoor I life of the winter months. There is I no other season when the blood is so I mueh in need of purifying and enrich- j ing, and every dose of these Pills helps I to make new, rich, red blood. In the | spring one feels weak and tired—Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills give strength. In the spring the appetite if often poor —Dr. Williams' Pink Pills develop the appetite, tone the stomach and aid weak digestion. It is in the spring that poisons in the blood find an outlet in disfiguring pimples, eruptions, and boils—Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills speedily clear the skin because they go to the root of the trouble in the blood. In the spring anaemia, rheu* matism, indigestion, neuralgia, erysipelas and many other troubles are most persistent because of poor, weak Wood, and it is at this time when all nature takes on new life that the blood most seriously needs attention.

The propaganda just issued states that one of its reasons for existence is the harsh manner in which Russian visitors at German watering places were treated when war was declared. It says that confirmed invalids were treated with a severity that was quite unnecessary.

Given a basis of good character, good health and thoroughness, the choice of life work. Is the next great influence t the upon a boy. Many parents foredoom Ugan is their son to failure by trying to force ’p|l(. him to gratify their ambitions in a call-I, -	, ing for which he has neither interest
11 Ul BOi ability instead , f helping him to 1. anil no doubt some plap of \ d, lop his own individuality.
Iwidcd The false idea that there Is social distinction In certain professions is the basis of many failures that might have | been successes in other callings.
Wherever we look we see failures, many of whom were men of undoubted ability, whose talents were misdirect-Oil. You whose sons have their future all before them can guard against shipwreck by studying their taste, tuer reeling their abilities and discuss: within the wi,h them the problem of their futu: *. !
if you cannot afford to see them through a long term of training for some profession discuss t lie matter freely so that they will appreciate the necessity of turning their interest into other channels—unless they can work their way through their training with->ut imixiirment of health.—Isaac L»vd-ham in Mother’s Magazine.

It is becoming moro and more a serious question how to retain the boys and girls on the o\l fai m and prevent their hegira to the city. If the present increase in urban population, and the corresponding deer taco in rural population continues, without I check, our nation must soon face one j of the most serious problt ms it has yet encountered. How are we to produce enough food and raiment to sustain life in the cities if the present proportion of those v. ho flock to the cities is to bo kept up i < r ? la a question vtich t economies are already seriously considering.
lT. S. census reports show that ! barely a majority of the rural vomI mu ni Vies manage to hold their own , in the matter of population, and a few have made slight gains, while a third of the counties have Io.st considerably.
It is a true saying that "the world looks to the farms for iUs living." The man who produces the things the world must have to sustain life will never have to worry about the bread and butter question.
Governor Capper of Kansas, stated | a great truth the other day, when he said that agriculture was the dustry which will never have a "bread line," and yet it is a deplorable fact, thaV not only the young people flocking to the cities, but parents also going. This is true in Canada, as it is here. I can recall the t iras when your beautiful city of Toronto had less than 30,000 people, while It #
I now boasts of a little less than half I a million.
Forty-two per cent, of the farmers of Canada (and the same is true here)
I are operated by tenants. In 1910 only 87 per cent, of Vhe farms were in the hands of tenants, and in 1880 only 20 per cent, were so operated. Not all of these land owners, who now have tenants, have moved to the town

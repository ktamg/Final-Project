50-inch cantilever springs and a perfect distribution of weight make the Gray Dort one of the easiest riding cars on the market.
There is plenty of seat and leg room, too, in the 1916 Cray Dort, both in the driver s compartment and in the tonneau. You never fee 1 cramped in a Gray Dort. In short, the 1916 Gray Dort is a car that satisfies every automobile desire at a price well w ithin the reach of most families

Outside the club door, Vermont’s motor was drawn up at the side waiting for him. He looked at his watch, and was surprised at the lateness of the hour. Stepping hastily into the vehicle, he held up two fingers to the chauffeur, who apparently needed no other instructions; for the car glided off, and Vermont, as he passed the club, looked up at the windows with an ugly smile.
As Lord Standon had said, few knew

Undoubtedly the most picturesque non-military figure in England during these war days is a distinguished clergyman, the Right Rev. A. F. Win-nington Ingram, Bishop of London, says Edward Marshal, an American writer. He is the church militant incarnate, and has been ever since the war began. A great novelist might make him the venerable hero of one of the most fascinating psychological studies of war-born emotion ever written.

England’s Income Tax.
In the nature of a war tax the income tax was first imposed in England by Fill in 3709. It was a temporary Imposition and was graduated on all incomes from $2iX) to $1.000 a year, with a tax of 10 per cent on all incomes over $l,ouO. Addington reimposed the tax when the war with France broke out in 1803, and the rate was fixed at 5 per cent on incomes of $750 « year and over. On his return to power in ÎS03 Pitt continued the tax, and it was gradually Increased until IM,>, when it was abrogated. Peel revived it. however, for purely fiscal reasons in 1842. and, although his original Intention was to impose it only for three years, it has continued ever since.

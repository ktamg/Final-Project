A very serious member of the House of Commons is Mr. Arthur Bliss Copp, who succeeded the late Mr. Erumersoo In the representation of Westmoreland, New Brunswick, in February last year. He is large and rotund, and his hands get as busy as him tongue when he gets going. His eloquence is of the traditional Maritime brand; and it flows most copiously when a patronage scandal is being aired—and they grow plenteously in the ozone that comes from the Bay of Fundy.

Mr. Copp was indignant and eloquent. Raising his hand solemnly, he cried; I protest against the dismissal of this man from the Dorchester penitentiary. I know hereof I speak. I have been there.M
The House roared with delight; but Mr. Copp is not yet trained to laugh at his own expense.
Sir Robert Borden laughed boisterously when he heard the Copp story just told.
“It reminds me of an experience of Chief Justice Weatherbee of Nova Scotia, with a member of the bar who had forsaken the law for Journalism, and who returned to the courts a sharper, though perhaps a poorer man. The Chief Justice was remarkable for the frequency and length of his interruptions of counsel would make quite a long speech on a matter of no Immediate importance to the case before him.
“One day he interrupted the newspaper-lawyer who was arguing upon the propriety of sending a man to a Jail for less than two years In preference to sending him to a penitentiary for a longer term. The Chief Justice Intervened with a long dissertation upon the differences between the two kinds of institution and referred to a visit to Dorchester penitentiary.
“ 'When I arrived at the building,* be said, the first thing I saw was—'
“ ‘A lot of your old clients, my lord,' interrupted the newspaper-lawyer, whose turn had come."

“The LugiacT is one of the noblest records ever written of national glory md success.

“The Lusiad” took its name from Lnsius, who was said to have founded | W1 Lisbon. Its author was bom about ; mt 1520, and his career, which began brilliantly, was blighted by the death of a broken heart of the lady of his love, for whose sake he was banished from the land.	'
Camoens wrote “The Lusiad” In his banishment and was recalled In 1571, losing on the way all his property except his poem. Pensioned at first by the king, this great epic poet of Portugal died in great poverty and misery In 1570, when his patron was also dead.

Old Irish chronicles are fall of interesting references to the harp and its functions. Let us select the comparatively modern date of 718 A. D—modern indeed when we consider Craftine, who was a contemporary of Sappho— which contains these lines from a poem describing the tragic death of Curio Mac Da ire, king of West Munster at the period of the Incarnation. They are addressed to Fercelrtne, the king’s chief minstrel:

Knowledge and Culture.
A great memory does not make a philosopher any more than a dictionary can be called a grammar. There are men who embrace in their minds a vast multitude of ideas, but with little sensibility about their real relations toward each other. These may be antiquarians. annalists, naturalists; they may be learned in the law; they may be versed in statistics; they are most useful in their own place. I should shrink from speaking disrespectfully of them. Still, there is nothing in such attainments to guarantee the absence of narrowness of mind. If they are nothing more than well read men or men of Information they have not what specially deserves the name of culture of mind or fulfills the type of liberal education.—Newman.

The church steeple was originally designed as a means of advertising the situation of the -church. Among the low buildings which originally prevailed the steeple was an impressive beacon. but under modern conditions It Is a failure, as even the most towering steeple Is lost among the higher industrial structures reared around It The steeple Is really being replaced by electricity. which answers the purpose much more satisfactorily. Electrically illuminated signs are being Introduced quite extensively for this purpose.

General Foy, the French military critic of tbe time of Napoleon, speaking of Napoleon's strength and bis weakness, said: "Only tbe founders of religion have exercised upon their followers an authority comparable to that which made him the absolute master of bis armies.

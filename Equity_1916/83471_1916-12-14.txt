Leather is being worn out faster today than ever before in the history of the world, while production is considerably less than a few years ago. While the consequent shortage is keenly' felt by the civilian

Government, which sands of soldiers.
Rubber, too, is being used in enormous quantities on account of the war-one British manufacturer, tor instance, is working on a rubber boot order for the army which will take 14,000,000 pounds of rubber, a >ric and chemicals. But the supply, thanks to the great rubber plantations in Britain’s tropical Dominions, is easily keeping up with the demands, and raw rubber, despite a war tax of	is actually cheaper
today than before the war. So, though the fabric and chemica s used cost nearly double, rubber footwear has not gone up very much in price.
These conditions naturally arc leading thoughtful, thrifty, patriotic Canadians to save leather just as much as possible by wearing rubbers, overshoes, high rubber boots and heavy farm rubbers. In addition to the \erv substantial saving in cost, rubber footwear has decided advantages for wet or cold weather around the farm or in the woods. The men like its warm, dry comfort under all conditions, and the w omen like the way it sheds the dirt instead of bringing it in to melt and track around the house. For the children, too, particularly if they arc walking a long way to school, rubbers and overshoes mean a great < e.il m warmth, comfort and protection against colds.
Doing Without Rubbers or Overshoes Is Simply Thoughtless Extravagance

In the deputation were judges, officials of temperance organizations, clergymen, and laymen of all callings. They held steadfastly to their straight demand, and refused to be diverted by intimations that light drinks should be excepted.
They impressed the Government officials strongly by their unity and zeal. Sir Loraer Gouln pledged serious attention to the arguments presented, Intimating that it was more a question as to whether the public opinion of the province had been educated to insist on enforcement of such a law, and less-a question of the righteousness of prohibition itself.
i The character of this deputation, as well as its size, the respect with which it was treated, and the answer It received, all combine to make friends of tcmperanc* throughout Canada more hopeful. It has been assumed by many that Quebec must be left out of any general prohibition scheme, however remote its complete accomplishment. The supposition, for a long time, has been that eccies-( ittawa, December 6. That certain iastical and political

But he never came. The days grew into weeks and the weeks into months and still she looked in vain.
There had been n heavy rush of work at the station, and Marjory was feeling worn out one evening as she prepared to collect the tickets on her last train—for she did not work in the late evening hours.
She gave her usual warning of 41 All tickets, please!” and prepared to take her stand by the gate just as the rush of passengers came along.

Somehow this particular morning Marjory felt happy, although there was a chilly wind blowing, and the cemented platform struck cold through her stout shoes. She found herself

There are hundreds of girls, especially, who have not time to go home, or who, if they do go home, are greatly pressed for time. With this service at their disposal they will save car fare; they will get a thoroughly satisfying luncheon; and they can have the Comfort of the lounge room in connection on wet or cold days—a lounge room which contains a piano, magazines

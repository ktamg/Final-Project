The distinguished party had to meet the emergency by sitting up all night, revolver in hand, and by endeavoring to keep a belt of fire alight around the care.

Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills act directly on the blood, making it rich and red, and this enriched blood strengthens weak nerves, stimulates tiretj muscles and awakens the normal activity of the glands that supply the digestive fluids. The first sign of improving health Is an improved appetite, and soon the effect of these blood making pills is evident throughout the system. You find that what you eat does not distress you, and that you are strong and vigorous instead of irritable and listless.

Yaw.iîng.
Yawning is n peculiar act and one that has never yet been properly accounted for. It is not by any means a sign of fatigue only, although it Is sometimes produced by overexert ion. !
But an attack of yawning comes on l much more quickly if one is Intensely bored, and certainly n stuffy atmosphere tends to produce It. It Is also noticeable that when one has gone considerably past one’s mealtime the tendency to yawn frequently becomes Irresistible. A very peculiar feature of in this complaint Is Its infectiousness; one person can easily set balf a dozen all yawning In turn. When present in a very marked extent It Is supposed to be the outcome of anaemia, indigestion or some other complaint

il'v-Mariv. 11th July, l!Uf>.	It	is in China’s Imports of flour
I D Tki f mis. < *. •: k of wiul r > irt that Canada is at present chiefly interested. The returns show that the Chinese consumption of foreign flour is subject to great fluctuation Instance, in 1907 It was a little more than three million barrels years later it fell to less than half a million
lb 1914, the year in which the war began, it amounted to one and a half million barrels. Fully one half came from the British possession of Hong Kong. Four hundred and thirty-one thousand barrels came from the United States; 231,300 barrels from Japan; and only 15,104 barrels from Canada
quantity but three times as much as Canada sent two years before, and some of the flour that went into China proper from Hong Kong. Four hundred and thirty-one thousand barrels came from the United States;
231,300 barrels from Japan; and only 15,104 barrels from Canada— comparatively a small quantity but three times as much as Canada sent two years before, and some of the flour that went into China proper from Hong Kong was of Canadian origin.
In summing up, the Trade Commissioner writes:
“As far as the present Is concerned a comparatively email number of the Inhabitants of China are able to buy foreign flour at war-time prices. On the other hand there must always be a demand for considerable quantities of foreign flour to satisfy the needs of the foreign population as well as the more wealthy Chinese, and the nearer the foreign article approaches the native product In price to that extent will be determined the amount of the former imported Into the Chinese market,”

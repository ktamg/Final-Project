B. junior team was responsible for two disappointment* occasioned in the same manner, after games were advertised and arrangement* made with the Rink Co., the jolt of another breach of faith at the opening of the season, looked to the Pet# like running the joke a little too fur, mid it is likely now that before they again agree to take on the C.

Entirely Proper and Permissible.
Boys are especially noted for eating well, but not always wisely. Take Penrod, for instance. It is recorded that on a certain afternoon, when a circus was in town, he consumed the following articles in the order here set down: A pickle, raspberry, lemonade, sardines, cider, watermelon, peanuts, popcorn, waffles, ice cream, taffy, sausage. He survived, as almost all boys do under similar circumstances, albeit the doctor was called to the aid of Providence.

The masculine foot, forming an approximate average of four different countries, was about twelve Inches long. This would require at least a No. 10 shoe to cover It comfortably.
The average masculine foot today Is easily fitted with a No. 8% shoe and is, therefore, not above ten and seven-sixteenths Inches. Now, by tbe old sculptural rule of proportion a man fire feet nine Inches In height should have a foot eleven and one half Inches long, or one-sixth his height.

The most minute and instructive account that exists of Booth’s acting was written by him—a book called '‘The Tragedian”— and Gould’s marble bust of Booth, a noble work of art (made before the comedian Flynn broke Booth’s nose with a pewter pot), is the best likeness of that great actor.

Early History of Rubber.
Rubber Is first known to history as a plaything. It was during Columbus'

Even as early as the beginning of the seventeenth century, bow ever, the Spaniards used rubber to wa 0 terproof their cloaks, but the fact attracted no attention In the old world,
and it was not until the eighteenth only for the space of four or hve min*	rt*»Liil Lrovgl the I century that the rubber industry be- utes. and during that short period it
hi* gan. Early writers mention an oil extracted from rubber which was taken skierable size ¦ ' medicinally with cocoa.

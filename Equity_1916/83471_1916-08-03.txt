As we walked toward the doorway of the walled, windowless structure, I imagined that I should see languorous Eastern beauties In baggy bloomers and gilt slippers. 1 dreamed of marble baths wherein olive-skinned beauties lolled. I thought of precious perfumes and beveled mirrors, of priceless jewels and of bronzed eunuchs waving peacock fans, while servant maids gently brushed the soft tresses of the harem favorites; but these dreams did not last long. . . .

The women before me were not beautiful; most of them were absolutly commonplace; some were stupid-looking. A few wore bright-colored scarfs about their necks, with jewelry 6n their ankles and wrists. The popular article of dress, however, was a short baggy “Mother Hubbard" garment, worn over yellow trousers. Gilt or beaded slippers adorned the feet of the young women; the older ones were barefooted.

Hardly had the old pasha withdrawn when the women were about me. And j such chattering, giggling, exclaiming, | pulling and pushing as followed? It | was a great day—a day long to be ' remembered in that harem. As far as | I could learn, I was the first woman from the Western world who had ever visited them; I was the first white woman some of them had ever seen.
They felt of my hands and face, got down on their knees to admire my high-heeled shoes, stroked the skirt of my tailored suit, and behaved like children with a new toy. My hatpins were a source of great wonder, and my tight-fitting suit brought forth many a fervent "Ali-a-a-h?" They asked me how many children I had, and wanted to know how I had managed to get out of the harem alone.
When I told them I was a Christian, and that my countrymen have only one wife apiece, and that she may come and go as she likes, they were voluble in their pity do not wish to leave the harem

Reconstruction Work
If the car is run too slowly or fast, there is fuel waste—15 m.p.h. is a good average.
Until now the average motorist has been careless about the amount of fuel he used because it was comparatively cheap and was a small percentage of the total car expense.
Make sure thab you are getting all the gasoline you pay for; some owners are not the pump to see that it registers the correct number of gallons, and that the operator does not hamper with it while filling your tank more, be certain that you obtain full measure; some gasoline pumps leak. It is necessary to check the amount in your tank by freqeunt measurement. Or, if this is not feasible, it is advisable occasionally to buy a gallon in a can of your own, and measure the quantity when you get home.
Most cars can be operated with a leaner mixture without affecting the production of power; some motorisbs may even deem it advisable to run with a very lean adjustment, notwithstanding a reduction in hill-climbing ability or speed

With the pleasant days of summer, comes a tendency for every motor car owner to overlook the necessary care of certain parts of his car which can't be seen.
One of these parts is the storage battery, and because of the important part it plays in starting, lighting and ignition, too much emphasis cannot be laid upon its care.

there Is a difference of 35,168 miles of track. That in a word tells the n applica-j gtory of the progress Canada has
made in railway building.
During the past year our mileage increased by almost five thousand miles, the largest increases being in Ontario and British Columbia.
The capitalisation of railways In operation amounts to $1,875,810,888; the gross income last year amounted to almost twenty million dollars; forty-six and a third million passengers were carried during the year, and eighty-seven million tons of freight. There were 360 persons killed and 1,578 injured through the movement of trains. Of the 360 killed only 17 were passengers, 102 were employes, 168 were trespassers, and 73 non-trespassers. Only one passenger was killed in every two million, seven hundred and twenty-four thousand passengers carried.
Railway employes last year numbered 124.142, and their salaries and wag#1 amounted to $20,215,727.

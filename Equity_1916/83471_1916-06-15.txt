Our 1910 Sailors are well made, neatly finished, and have a distinctive appearance—Sennet Straws, Snap Brim Straws, Sailors.
The 1916 Gray Dort sells for $850, yet it has the appearance and looks of a considerably more expensive car.
Electric starting, electric lighting, demountable rims, extra rim, gasoline gauge and speedometer on dash—and all those little conveniences that make motoring a pleasure are yours if you own a Gray Dort.
50-inch cantilever springs and a perfect distribution of weight make the Gray Dort one of the easiest riding cars on the market.
There is plenty of seat and leg room, too, in the 1916 Gray Dort, both in the driver's compartment and in the tonneau. You never feel cramped in a Gray Dort. In short, the 1916 Gray Dort is a car that satisfies every automobile desire at a price well within the reach of most families.
See the Gray Dort at our showrooms.

THAT FORTY INCH WAIST.
It Means Overeating, Underexercieing and Future Poor Health.
“Beware of a forty inch waist line," says a bulletin from the North Carolina state board of health. “Ten to one the man who Is five feet eight inches tall and forty Inches about the waitft will sooner or later have to consult a doctor for gallstones and kidney trouble and most likely for Bright's or some other serious disease.
“Forty Inches about the waist Is an abnormal size and condition and shows that he who carries such a burden around with him has an appetite of an abnormal size and proportion. It further shows that something is wrong with his diet oç that his energy is reduced to naught His appetite Is either several sizes too big or he ‘sits tight1 on exercising. Most likely ho eats excessively of meats, pastries and heavy foods, which means overworked kidneys and faulty elimination.
“There is usually one, and only one, diagnosis to be made of this class— Tat and forty/ Their bulkiness, flabbiness and shortness of breath are symptoms having for their cause ‘overfed and underworked.
The bulletin concludes with, “Overfeeding contributes more to disease and premature deaths than underfeeding."

Milking on Hither Side
"Hey, there! You’re milking on the I wrong side!” shouted a neighbor one I morning ah he came upon me sitting quietly on the left side of a cow while 1 milked, says a writer in the Iowa
Homestead.
Why, now, should there In? tiny difference which side of the cov' we sit $ | on while milking? I asked this neigh- , bor why, and he finally had to admit that it is all a habit, this having one | particular side to milk on—th j “right | aide.’’
Here on our place we train the cow from calf hood to be approached and handled from the left side the same as from the right, and by the time she drops her first calf there is no “right side” for her—we milk her from just whichever side is handiest.
Let us consider the numerous advantages we gain by milking the cow from cither aide. First, a cow is not so apt to be a confirmed kicker if milked from either side. It is a fact that the mere touch of the hand, extended too far over on the left side, causes the cow to kick. If she were milked from either side at will, any-i thing of this sort would not excite her. Many time.* it is much more conveni-j ent to approach n cow from the left ! side than from the right side, espec-ipns u ui pauyuoj si aqs o.nq w A||vt or stanchion. Sometimes we must disturb two cows to reach one, where

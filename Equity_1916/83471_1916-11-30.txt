British Flantatioa Rubber Is Saving Canada Millions
=ü
mockeries
Low Prices of Rubbers and Overshoes Due to Britain’s Control of Situation
Here in Canada many of us have fallen into the truly Anglo-Saxon habit of considering the “ Mother of Parliaments ” slow and a bit behind the times. The present price of rubber, when its cause is revealed, affords one of the many proofs that such an opinion is away off the mark.
Thanks to great rubber plantations established, in the face of criticism and ridicule, many years before in her tropical Dominions, Great Britain at the outbreak of war held a firm and tightening grip on the world's supply of raw rubber—a grip reinforced by her dominating navy. From 60% in 1914, the production of these plantations has grown this year to 75% of the whole world’s output, leaving only about half the requirements of the United States alone to come from all other sources.
The result has been that the needs of the Allies, enormous though they are, have been plentifully supplied, while Germany has been reduced to registered mails and the “ Deutschland " in desperate attempts to mitigate her rubber famine. Neutrals have been allowed all the rubber they want, at prices actually lower than before the war, so long as they prevent any of it from reaching the enemy, while Canada and other parts of the Empire have an abundant supply at equally favorable Government regulated prices.
In this forpwlght mnd generosity of the British Government lie# the reason why rubber alone, of all the great simple#, has not gone up In price—why rubber boots, rubbers and overshoes are as Jnexpeftsive as ever, while leather ehoe* are costing several dollars a pair more. Wearing rubbers or overshoes through ti ls winter to protect these expensive shoes, or rubber farm shoes to replace them, is more than practical thrift- It Is grateful patriotism, for hi thus saving leather ke it easier for the Government to secure the absolutely ery supplies of this alarmingly scarce material for our soldiers.

Mr. C. W. Brett, managing director of Barimar, Ltd., scientific welding engineers, writes as follows in the London Chronicle:
I Germany's intention to obtain an I initial advantage in the fight for the : world’s trade is plainly seen in the so: cial and economic reconstruction that has been proceeding throughout the ! Fatherland side by side with the country’s gigantic efforts on all the fronts. In nothing is this idea of Germany more plainly seen than in the latest scheme announced, by which the great armoring firm of Krupp,
1 with its scores of thousands of mechanics, is to be linked up with the ¦ North German Lloyd S-Vamship lines, j The Essen firm has now purchased an I interest in the steamship company,
! and one of its directors is to have a seat on the board.
! This adroit move is not a mere pri-i vate commercial transaction. It has ! a much wider significance of which j we, in this country, should take due note. While Teuton submarines have I been busily engaged sending to the bottom as many British ships as pos-| fible, existing German craft have been safely interned in home or neutral ports. Meanwhile German shipbuilders have been steadily building new

. . FROM . .
Each year smile new feature of importance to the tanners of Eastern Ontario and Quebec is brought out or emphasized at the Ottawa Winter Fair ami the HU7 Show, which will be held from January Pith to 19th., will be no exception. Each year also finds this great Winter Fair larger than ever before in one or more departments. Sheep and (anility were -|>eeial features at the last Show, both these departments having the largest and best display in the history of the Show.
Ottawa is situated in one of the greatest dairy sections in Canada and should have the best three day Dairy Test of any Show in Canada. The dairy classes will be a special feature in connection with the coming Show. The dairy buildings are unequalled by any other show in Canada and the conditions are ideal for making high records, as the animals are tta bled in the most modern, well lighted, heat and ventilated stables. Arrangements are being
made for tin- installment of equip-1 Bristol School Commissioners ruent that will make it (xxssible to test the milk after each milking and to have the results tabulated and posted in the stables, so that the exhibitors will know after each milking just exactly what their animals are doing. Arrangements are also being made for having the stables specially superintended so that the ventilation and sanitary conditions will be as near ideal as possible.
In connection with special nrivi-leges extended to members ot Farmer's Institutes, the Executive of 1 he Ottawa Winter Fair have found it advisable and necessary to discontinue extending special pass privileges to the members of the Farmer's Institutes and County Hoards of Agriculture. Although the Institute passes have been discontinued, a general sjierinl admission rate has been adopted in the way of strip tickets at the rate of eight for one dollar and these may be obtained through Secretaries of County Boards of Agriculture.

Already behind them could be heard the battle-music of saw and axe, broken into nnw and again by the sudden scream of the steam-driven •'circular.1' Sundry gaps appeared now and again in the dark line of foliage—each gap meant the fall of a giant, and no giant has ever been dismembered so speedily as he.

After the luxury of Adrien’s rooms the mean quality of her own apartment struck the girl more forcibly than usual, and sinking upon the bed, she covered her face with her hands and gave way to a flood of tears. But the weakness did not last long; and after n moment or two, with a sud-ren gesture, almost Italian in its intensity, she flung back her head and rose from her crouching position.

"Ah, that's the style! The swell lady ought to have heard you talk like that. She’d say I was bringing you up well. Come here and let’s have a look at you.”
Jessica did not move, but stared at him nteadily.
"What! You won’t come?” he said with a grin. "Well, there’s something for your obstinacy, you little mule!
He flang a half-crown across to her, and Jessica took it up, then looked him questioningly in the face.
"You’re thinking I’m mighty generous, eh? So I am, my girl— foolishly generous.' He laughed mockingly.
"Well, what do you say if all the lot’s for you,eh ? ”

The root crop has done much for sheep, providing winter food, there is a strong prejudice against roots for breeding ewes. This is not altogether warranted, for, under certain conditions where grass land is scarce, a very high percentage of lambs is obtained from ewes which are very largely maintained on roots, particularly on swedes. It is quite possible that the prejudice arises for want of a better system of manage-

Looking back, she remembered but little beyond the days she had passed with Johann and his shrewish wife.

"Would you be very much cut up.’’ he said slyly, "if she wasn't able to trouble you any more, or answer awkward questions, miss?”
She turned on him with a fierceness that made him recoil.
“If anything happens to that gal,” she houted, "I'll turn the police on you. For, mind my words—I mean them-I shouldn't have cared yesterday very much, if I had learnt she was dead, but now I want her. Do you hear? Ï want her. and you take care she's alive and ready when I come for her.”
Then, without vouchsafing any further information, she flounced away, leaving Mr. Wilfer staring blankly after her, and wishing for once that he had stayed his hand, instead of driving the girl into the miseries and dangers of the street*.

ment.
Naturally, a ewe cannot maintain herself and develop her lamb on swedes alone. She should have plenty of dry food. It is very important where sheep are put almflst entirely on roots that dry food should be given at once. It is not ne^sary to give very rich dry food early, most any dry food will do so long as the sheep will eat it, and it is helpful and not expensive.
As a rule, the more nitrogenous matter the food contains the better. In cold weather there should be no sparing of food, especially to sheep in exposed places.

Justice in Fuse Enquiry Him Enhanced His Reputation.
Whatever reputations are made or unmade by the Royal Commission which probed the Kyte charges, the already high prestige of one man has been powerfully enhanced Lyman P. Duff has often been referred to as the “brains'* of the Supreme Court of Canada.
When Justice Duff was asked by the Government to act with Sir William Meredith on the Fuse Commission he began well by stipulating that

Edward Blake in the celebrated Alaska boundary arbitration case. His work in the latter connection attracted such favuiable attention that he was called to the Supreme Court of British Columbia. In 1906 Sir Wilfrid Laurier appointed him to the Supreme Court of Canada.

Director of the Bureau of Ceramics of the Dominion Geological Survey; one by Edward Orton, Jr., Professor of Ceramics of the Ohio State College, and one from McGill University, Montreal. These documents demonstrate that the Canadian clay, In addition to its high ceramic value, possesses all the characteristics necessary for the manufacture of the highest grades of paper, and also the qualities which suit it for the manufacture of paint pigments and of many toilet articles by the manufacturing chemists. The expectation Is that porcelains equal to those of tbe finest French manufacture may be made in Canada as It has been found by tests made in Limoges, France, that the Canadian clays are equally suitable as the French kaolin.
The market Is wide, for tbe supplies of kaolin on the North American continent have not sufficed to meet domestic requirements vlval of immigration will produce, automatically, a keen demand for table wares, and electricity is merely on the threshold of development Tbe Canadian pioneers in this new potential Industry, undoubtedly, will have the keenest of competitors to face, but tbe purity and abundance of tbe supply and the Incidentals to manufacture, with the possible exception of labor, are factors In their favor. At present tbe consensus of opinion among the experts concerned, appears to be that with a little mothering," the Industry can be established, and that Canada has.

To Advertise Canada
The Dominion Government Is going Into the moving picture business. It is not doing so with the idea of making money, but with the object of interesting people, both In and out of Canada, in the natural resources of this Dominion.
Arrangements have, it is understood, been concluded and camera men have already started at work filming scenes from one end of Canada to the other. These will comprise views of the country's scenic beauties and pictures of various of its Industrial systems. They will be carefully chosen so as to present the Dominion not only as a garden of nature, but also as a land of opportunity. They represent the application of the most modern and popular of pictorial devices to the work of promoting immigration and interesting capital in this country, and will be of use in a variety of ways and by many different branches of the Government service.
Mr. Francis Holley, Director of the Bureau of Commercial Economics, Washington, now recognised as one of the greatest modern educational institutions In the world tawa recently In connection with this matter. It Is understood Mr. Holley has Interested the Canadian Government in the project, and thst he has offered to exhibit any views tbst may be taken free to millions of cltisens of tbe United States throughout the medium of tbe bureau. The offer is one which, It Is likely, will be gratefully accepted by the Government.

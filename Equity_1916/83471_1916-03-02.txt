Why, From a Legal Standpoint, There i	Is Now No Such Title.
There la no such person now a$ the emperor of Germany, and there never has been so far as a Prussian king la concerned. Further, there Is reason why such Is so. It Is no mere quibble over the form of a name.
Emperor of Germany was a title as sumed by Rudolph, count of Hapsburg in 1273. By the pragmatic sanction of 1439 the title, then held by Albert II., was conflned in perpetuity to the bouse of Austria.

A clever medical writer has said that "Neuralgia Is a cry from the nerves for better blood." In other words, neuralgia is not a disease—It Is only a 6ymptom, but a very painful one. Neuralgia is the surest sign that your blood is weak, watery and impure, and that your nerves are literally starving. Bad blood is the one cause—rich, red blood the only cure. This gives you the real reason why I)r. Williams' Pink Pills cure neuralgia. They are the only medicine that contains in correct proportions the elements needd to make rich, red blood. This new, rich blood reaches the root of the trouble, soothes the jangled nerves, drives away the nagging, stabbing pain, and braces up your health in other ways as well. In proof of these statement?* Mrs. A. T. Oulton, Little Shemogue, N.B., says:—"A few years ago my mother was in intense sufferer from neuralgia, which was located in her face, head and shoulders. The pain, especially in her head, was intense. She doctored for some time without getting relief and there seemed to be no ceasing of the pain whatever. Instead it seemed to he extending and her whole nervous system became affected. Finally she decided to try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. After taking them for a while the pain in her head became less severe, and of course this was a great relief to her. Under the continued use of the Pills she felt herself growing better and stronger each day until she was no longer a sufferer and was completely cured, and has felt no symptoms of the trouble since."

You can get Dr. Williams Pink Pills from any medicine dealer, or by mail, post paid, at 50 cents a box or six boxes for $2.50, from The Dr. Williams Medicine Co., Brockville, Ont.

LOST IN WAR TIME.
A newspaper man who had left the army from illness determined to become a huckster for a day to see what there was in the business. His experiment seems to show that at the bottom, the fault, of it exists, is due as much to the inherent desire felt by human nature to buy something when the opportunity has not occurred for sometime.
About 6:80 one morning he laid out his little stock on the steps of a church in a little village of some thirty houses, for or five of which were still intact. To his right he I placed the soaps, of many colors, and the perfumes to the left, letter paper,' collections of songs and in the middle knitted goods, socks, etc., under which , were hidden a few bottles—not bob-1 tics containing alcohol, the risk of( prison would have been too great— 1 but of coca wine, quinquina and such apertifs of legal degree of spirit.

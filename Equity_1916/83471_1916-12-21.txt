The once great house of the Haps-burgs has lost its most distinguished representative in the recent death of Francis Joseph, the aged ruler of Austria.
This distinguished race of kings takes their name from a famous an"	cielit house in Switzerland, but is not
the name of the occupants. The place of origin in this case, having superseded the residents, the name has clung to the descendants through all subsequent history.
The aged monarch, whose funeral rites at Vienna will soon be observed in n manner befitting a king, ascended his throne in the midst of revolution, and it is only fitting that he descend from it as he has, while the nation is wrapped in gloom of treacherous war, that forbodes national disaster to his confiding subjects.
His kingdom is yet in the balance, and no matter who wins, his dominions are almost certain to be dismembered. The dual monarchy is doomed, however the struggle may end.
Francis Joseph, emperor of Austria, and a sort of apostolic King of Hungary, reigned but did not govern during the latter period of hie life.
He supinely placed himself in subjection to the will of another and much greater sovereign—the Kaiser.

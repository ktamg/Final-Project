One of the foremost medical writer# says: "It in astonishing the number of people who have been crippled in health for years after nil attack of la grippe or influenza." The real danger from this disease, which sweeps over Canada every winter, is during convalescence, when the characteristic symptoms, the fever, the catarrh, the headaches and the depression of spirits pass away. Grip leaves behind it weakened vital powers, thin blood, impaired digestion and over-sensitive nerves—a condition that makes the system an easy prey to pneumonia, bronchitis, rheumatism, nervous prostration and even consumption. It is a condition that calls most emphatically for a tonic for the blood. Dr. William.*’ Pink Pills are a tonic especially adapted to meet this need as they $ purify and enrich the blood. They 4 tone up the nerves and give vigor,	8

. Buttons From flam Shell».
Canada has natural resources of which little is known. One of these, which is of but recent development, is the clam-shell fishery. In many of the inland streams, large quantities of shells may be found. From the Grand river, in South-Western Ontario, alone no less than 165 tons of the clam or washboard shell have been taken. Other species found Id 1 the Grand river are the mucket shell and sand shell.
| A use has been found for these shells in the manufacture of fresh , water pearl buttons. For this purpose, from two to three hundred tons are used annually, a considerable portion of which comes from the

being 11-16 of an inch in thickness.
I They are afterwards split to the required thickness for buttons.
| After the discs are cut from the shell, there Is still a use found for what might be considered a factory waste. The perforated shell Is ground up and sold for chicken grit, for which It Is admirably adapted.

»
Roumanians and Greek* who have lately left Germany report marked disappointment on all sides at the prolongation of the war, and especially the renewal of Russia’s lighting strength, says a Pvtiograd correspondent.
A Greek otlicer says that suicides among wounded and convalescents occur painfully often. In the boarding-| house where he stayed for some time 1 In Berlin were eleven German officers recovering from sickness or wounds. Three of them killed themselves.
It is common talk in Germany that a hundred thousand were killed in the fruitless autumn campaign In Russia; the number of wounded and captured is, of course, far larger.
These losses might be borne with resignation if they gave decisive results, but, as Maximilian Harden ha* admitted in the Zunkunft, Russia will be stronger in the spring than at any time before, and the foolish dream of a separate peace has faded utterly away.
Furthermore, the difficulty and dearness of living depresses the poorei classes, and makes them eager to re turn to the former comfortable conditions of existence.

The Pets had the tables turned on them when they went to P. Ik Fort to play the return game on Saturday afternoon. On thi- occasion the locals seemed to have gained considerably in physical proportions since their appearance at Shaw ville, and the young-stera got sundry jolts into tin* boards which enclosed the rink, which rather took the viiu out of them. The result was a serious break in the winning -treak which has favored them during the past two season#. The score -tood 7-Li in favor of the local team.

Thanks to Mr. R. H. Coats, late editor of the Labor Gazette and now promoted to the position of Dominion statistician, we have a record of the course of wholesale prices in practically all articles of consumption, and covering the whole Dorain-I ,,t ion, for a full quarter-century. More || ’¦ than that, we have a carefully calculated average of these prices for the decade 1890-1900, and this average constitutes the ' Index number” for s Canada, the gauge by which all V'UiifortuMc dwelling wholesale prices in this country may barn (3GxO<>) witli now be measured. If one wishes to
consider the subject only cursorily, 1 he will find all the facts he needs in t the I^abor Gazette for July last, but if a more careful study is intended, the volume entitled Prices, Canada. 1914,j 1 consulted
the Labor Department, Ottawa.
! In the boom times of several years ago, the rise in prices was an annoyance. People complained of It, but When u vau* * • 'i \ for you were too busy to do mou- than i om-
plain.	the one
great word of command, the question of prices will have to be faced and dealt with. And, pending any action at $1.65 per IV# and up that may be taken by the public at
large. It will be money in the pocket of any individual to consider this question of prices with a view to reaching conclusions fur his own guidance.
The main chart, so to speak, of this system of price reporting is a Nmpi ior. Out. diagram showing by a line the course
of wholesale prices for the last twenty-five years. Beginning slightly above what afterwards proved to j be the average for the decade, prices fell rapidly from 1890 to 1897, when they touched eight points below. Almost the whole of this decline was of recovered in one steady rise before wt. the beginning of 1900. In that year fitrtii-h there was another slight reaction, followed by another long and steady kr» i x üO.or.1» mix--i waul rise which, by the year 1HU7, had
I hit 1 for carried prices twenty-six points
above the average. A fall of five points was recorded within two years thereafter, and that was the last seen of decline. Vp to the end of 1914 there was a rise to thirty-six points above the index number, Lut. and the monthly reports since then have shown that that rise continued during the first half of the present year, reaching a fraction over forty-seven points above the average In June.

This is a test you can apply to The House of Hobberlin Limited, in any of their 1300 agencies and stores. The banker, the doctor, the man of affairs, are the customers of this House wherever you go. When it is possible to please these—not one season, but season to season—the reason seems clear for pleasing you.

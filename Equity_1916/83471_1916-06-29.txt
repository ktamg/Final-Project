To wage war with the adult fly is to go into a ceaseless battle that can never be decisive in man’s favor. The flies form such a numerous host that it is impossible to kill them all in a ainglc season and a very few survivors are sufficient to propagate an equally numerous host the season following.	'
The only way to exterminate the fly is to attack it in the larval or maggot form. Flies lay their eggs in manure or garbage; ten days from the time of hatching the maggots < merge as winged insects, fully equipped for distributing disease-breeding bacteria. But a city with clean backyards and clean stable premises would be a flyless city, for it would have abolished the flies’ breeding-grounds. The plan of campaign against these annoying and dangerous pests is thus plain; wc must clean up, not once or twice a year, but all the time. Persons with dirty back-yards should be prosecuted. Privies should be abolis her wherever possible and, where allowed, should be kept continually disinfected and be cleaned twice weekly. The piling of refus in disgusting and unsightly “dumps" should never be permitted. If the town cannot afford an incinerator, the refuse should be buried.
Experiments conducted by the U S. Dept, of Agriculture have shown that the fly larvae in manure anil other refuse may be killed by treatment with borax, one pound of borax being sufficient to treat 16 cu. ft., or very nearly 13 bushels of manure. If used in larger quantities, the borax may prove injurious to plants. The borax should be sifted over the manure, particularly near the edges of the pile, which should then be sprinkled with four gallons of water. This treatment wil kill 98 to 99 per cent of all the larvae in the manure. At 11 cen*s per pound for borax, it is estimated that the eost would be 2 cents per horse per day. This cost could be very greatly reduced by employing calcined colemanite instead of Borax, if the former were imported in large quantities. One pound of

Some people have a tendency to become thin-blooded just as others have an inherited tendency to rheumatism or nervous disorders. The condition in which the blood becomes so thin that the whole body suffers comes on so gradually that anyone with a na-feiral disposition in that direction should watch the symptoms carefully.

Our present close union with Great Britain may be considered as an external alliance serving an external purpose, and unconnected with the internal life of either country. But there is another standpoint, and in my opinion the only true one. The complete independence of each Slate in its internal affairs is a truism, but it must be recognized that intimate rapproarhment necessarily leads to mutual influence, intellectual, moral, even «esthetic, and political and social ideals which form the basis of Hie greatness and power of Great Britain are to be more widely recognized and adopted In Russia.

“Oh, I’d fly up in the air with Aunt Lavinia, and I’d fly and fly till I couldn’t get any higher.”
“Yes, dear.” said mother, proudly, as the little chap paused imp ¦ . “What would you do then?”

Andrew Lang Didn’t Like Stevenson When They First Met.
Andrew Lang was the unyielding enemy of everything that savored of decadence. He particularly disliked the affected young aesthetics of the 1890’s.
And, although he came, as the world knows, to be the devoted friend of Itobcrt Louis Stevenson, his first Impressions of him were most unfa vont* 1______
bio, for he mistook him for an aesthete of the aesthetes.
In his book “On the Trail of Steven son" Clayton Hamilton gives a record of Andrew Lang's account of his first

For Service

Various anesthetizing media and methods were well known both In antiquity and during the middle ages. Homer mentions the anesthetic effects of nepenthe; Herodotus states that the Scythians obtained similar effects from the vapors of hemp, produced by throwing hemp seed on hot stones. A Chinese physician of the third century, B. C., gave his patients a preparation of hemp to make them Insensible during surgical operations.
The most Important anesthetic of ancient and medieval times was, bow-

which is mentioned by a great number of early writers and is referred to by Shakespeare. More recently, in the year 1700, the German surgeon, Weiss,! better known as Albinos, amputated the foot of Augustus III., king of Poland, while under the influence of mandragore.
Two other anesthetizing agencies were employed In very early times, arterial compression and hypnotism. '

However, he followed his wife to the room, and was relieved to be shown all sorts of ridt and disorder, which he himself would never have noticed, but no trace could he find of that for which he was looking.
Nothing had been touched; nothing that he could think of was missing. Even that damp outline on the boards had dried off now. He wished that he had examined it more carefully, but, after all, it could not have been old Mary in his room, though she apparently did know the way to it.
He paused for a long minute, and went over everything carefully with his eye. By George! his Winchester had gone. No. it hadn’t. There it was behind his oilskin, and there was absolutely nothing else which she could have wanted.

Bayadere Striped Skirt
For sports and morning wear, the awning striped materials, linens, ducks, and canvas weaves are particularly well liked. The stripes may run up and down, or around the figure as shown here. This skirt is fashioned of linen, combining several of the vivid colors now modish, and is worn with a shirt blouse of voile with vest of the linen. The square neck is a becoming feature. Among the simple waist models of the summer are many with the out'dde peplum. These are of voile organdy or Georgette, In pink, blue, pale green and similar shades, intended for wear with skirts of black taffeta or with white and colored wash skirts. Pongee is also favored for these outside blouses. Tiny buttons, steel, gilt or gunmetal, and a belt of black or colored ribbon about the only trimming for these unless it be a second collar of trasting shade.
Collars and cuffs are interesting details of blouses ; the cuffs usually fit tightly about the wrist, flaring becomingly over the hands, throat is of course the modish rangement for summer, although most of the shirt-waists and other blouses are made with the adjustable collar which may be worn high or low, fancied.

Now, I contend that you are German and to prove this assertion, if you will look on page 4 9 in the book entitled "List of Radio Stations," you will find that K.C.B.
Is one of the codes assigned to the German Government by the International Radio Convention, to be used by Germans only. Kindly advise tnrough your column which is right.

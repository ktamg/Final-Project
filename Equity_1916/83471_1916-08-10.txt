No/ said the child indignantly, ‘we are French now! Au revoir!' The authorities have found that 16 months’ schooling is sufficient to give an Alsatian boy or girl a thorough grounding in the language and literature which were once forbidden.

The high personage, as he accepted the flowers, asked the child whether she was fond of France. To his horror she replied, in French, of course,

Elephants Not Cowards.
The fear an elephant has for a rat has often been spoken of as an example of colossal cowardice. But it is nothing of the kind. The elephant, when captive and in chains, has every reason to regard with terror the little rodent, which, in the still watches of the night, gnaws the toenails of the helpless pachyderm. Not much of this sort of thing is required to make the huge creature lame.

Hia Famous Lineage.
Tht Lindsays are one of the greatest houses in Scotland. The Earl of Crawford is the twenty-seventh earl— the premier Earl of Scotland. The house has a very remote feudal, and even legendary, hietory, an cestor being reputed to be descended from "Thor,” who was reputed to be the son of "Odin.” The family is supposed to be related to William the Conqueror, and members of it frequently intermarried with the Royal Scottish houses of Bruce and Stuart

Measuring the Wind.
• The speed of the wind is measured by means of an ingenious instrument called the areometer. It is like a weather vane, with cups instead of letters at the ends of Its arms. The \ cup#, catching the wind, whl* round, and thus turn the central shaft This , passes down into a box in which are 1 several dials. The indicators of those dials are connected with the shaft end move according to lie revolutions. Thus the number of revolutions of the cup In a certain time gives the exact speed in miles per hour.

OUR AIR WILL NOT FAIL US


No Need to Fear That the Nitrogen Will Ever Be Exhausted.
A student nt the University of Wash Ington, having read about making n! frogen from the air, entered the ebem Istry department and asked the professors there what would happen when all the nitrogen had been taken out of ; the nir. The University of Washing ton News Letter says that this Is w hat they toy him:
“The atmosphere over a square mile of land Is estimated to contain 20,0(0,-000 tons of nitrogen, which Is enough to furnish all the world would require for fifty years at the present rate of consumption. Kven If that were not so, there would be no danger, for there’s a sort of 'dust to dust' process Involved that Is a safeguard in itself. I
“Nitrates when they go into the soli are taken up by the roots of plants and utilized. After the plant decays the nitrogen is given off, and it returns again to the atmosphere.
“If employed In the manufacture of explosives, when the charge is exploded part of the nitrate returns to the air ns gas, while some goes into solution, ; falls to the earth and is taken up by the plants, returning later to the air/*

Vernet In a Storm at Ses.
Vernet, the celebrated painter of sea pieces, eager in the study of nature, made several long voyages In his younger days In order to observe the various scenes which the changeful elements exhibit In one of these excursions undertaken merely for the love of the art a most violent gale of wind arose, when Vernet, without attending to the perils with which he was surrounded, desired one of the sailors to lash him fast to some of the rigging. Boon after this request was granted the storm Increased, attended with thunder and lightning and with every circumstance that could add to the horror of the scene, snd consternation and terror sat on every countenance. but in the young painter every emotion was lost In that of admiration, which so wholly engrossed his attention that be every now and then exclaimed In the most enthusiastic terms,

The 1916 Gray Dort sells for $850, yet it has the appearance and looks of a considerably more expensive car.
Electric starting, electric lighting, demountable rims, extra rim, gasoline gauge and speedometer on dash—and all those little conveniences that make motoring a pleasure are yours if you own a Gray Dort.
50-inch cantilever springs and a perfect distribution of weight make the Gray Dort one of the easiest riding cars on the market.
There is plenty of seat and leg room, too, in the 1916 Gray Dort, both in the driver’s compartment aed in the tonneau. You never feel cramped in a Gray Dort. In short, the 1916 Gray Dort is a car that satisfies every automobile desire at a price well within the reach of most families
See the Gray Dort at our showrooms.

Well, mother, our 1 >t battalion has all l»een split up. They are in a nutnlier of other battalions. We did not bring our officers with ti> and all the n. c. os. have lieen reduced to privates. We did not even bring our colonel, I mud or base. There were sure some sights when we left there. The fellows who were left behind cried like Uibies when we left. When we arrived in France we were again split up into small units. Kven brothers were parted. 1 was lucky. I have two friend* who have lieen with me ever si nee we enlisted.

In speaking of the terrible conflict at Verdun, the Lille Kriegszeitung, a newspaper which is edited and published by German soldiers in Lille, behind the German front, has the following Interesting comments to make comparing the battlefields of a tury ago with those of to-day.
This terrible war—all previous wars in history compared to it mere child’s play!" the publication says. "The present war up to the first of this year was so horrifying, so tragic and so destructive that it was believed that it was impossible that anything worse could occur. But something worse has occurred. It began February 21, and now we are in the first week of June. For three long months this terrible battle has been waged on a front of forty kilometers day and night without nation.

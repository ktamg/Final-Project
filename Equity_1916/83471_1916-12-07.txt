Î1' Day by day he had pondered the matter over until at last his desire to set out for the South became almost uncontrollable. He felt, too, a strange glow of tender yet almost selfish interest at the thought of the cosy, smiling abode by the seashore where he would find the hostess, young and pretty, where her little children would hold out their arms to him, and their handsome father perhaps bear a gentle likeness to the charming, beloved woman of the days of long ago.
With his head sunk in the collar of his fur coat, the baron walked along, thinking all this over, and then suddenly he made up his mind. Hailing

He set forth homewards, and all at once there came to him a vision of his

writes:—’‘For several years I suffered terribly from nervous debility English Giant is Eight Feet Two and j and was scarcely able to do a thing.
During that time I consulted several doctors, and many medicines without getting any help, and I began to think that I would never get better. One day I saw Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills advertised and thought I would try them. After taking four boxes I was much better, but I continued using the pills for several months when I was again in the best of health. When I began taking the pills I weighed only 100 pounds. While under their use with my renewed health I now weigh 140. I recommend Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills to every one whom I know to be ailing.”
You can get Dr. Williams Pink Pills from any dealer in medicine, or by mail at 50 cents a box, or six boxes for $2.50 from the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Brockville, Ont

The work of constructing a great highway across Canada would be much less difficult than many Canadians think it would be, as, with the exception of the almost uninhabited district north of the Georgian Bay and I«ake Superior, all the parts of Canada through which it would pass already possess roads, which could be linked together so as to form on* continuous highway without serious difficulty. The road would probably •xtend from Halifax to Moncton, and from Moncton to some convenient point on the southern bank of the St. Lawrence, along which it would pass to a point opposite Quebec, w here the river would probably

In the death at the front of Major Gordon Southern, Canada has lost one of her most versatile and widely known athletes. Major Southam was serving with the 40th Battery In France when he gave hie life for his country.
In football, tennis, cricket, hockey, golf, squash racquets, and other lines well, of athletic endeavor Major Southam had gained fame. On several occa-sjons he was chosen on Canadian and Provincial teams. He was born In Hamilton about thirty years ago, and prepared at Upper Canada College for the University of Toronto, where ho took his degree In arts In 1907. During his course he was regarded as the best athlete wearing the blue and white. In addition be was a clever student, and his sterling traits of character earned him the respect and admiration of all with whom he came in contact.
For three years he played on the U. of T. Intercollegiate senior football and hockey teams. He won the novice championship of the University at tennis. When the Canadian Zlngari toured England and met the best cricket,teams of the old country Major Southam was one of the stars of the tourists. He also earned a place on Canadian International elevens. With him In cricket were closely associated Lieut.-Colonel W.
R. Marshall and Lieut. Waldemar Marshall, both of whom have also given their lives at the front. Ih 1907 he was champion of the Iamb-ton Golf Club.
Perhaps there was never a more iroflf lent barkfleld player in Canadian
senior football than the late Major | Ready-made < akes Must Not Contain

The discussion of the scope of the law In making It an offence for a citizen to have liquor in his possession except upon his own residential premises apparently indicates a way out for the man with the flask. According to the view expressed at the License Department, the Act makes It legal for a person to "carry liquor from one place where it may be legally kept to another place where it may be legally kept.” For a person to	from his home to th*
home of a neighbor or friend, both | ing# ; well fenced and drained ; runnin*
being places where liquor may be legally kept, is stated to be within the law.
While one or two convictions have indicated that having liquor on the person is to be construed as a violation of the law. it is said that the Act in its bearing upon this point will be used moro to keep a check upon the operations of bootleggers than to harry the man who likes to have a "nip” about.

Rubber Supply Steady While Leather Gets Scarcer
This Explains Low Price of Rubber Footwear in Spite of Increase in Cost of Chemicals, Fabrics and Labor.
The war is using up enormous quantities, both of leather ami rubber. At the same time it is seriously restricting the output of the former, much of which came from Russia—while rubber production keeps pace with the demand. From the great plantations now reaching maturity in Britain’s tropical Dominions will come this year 150,000 tons of raw rubber—75% of the world’s production, and an increase of 40,000 tons over last year.
Thus, thanks to the British Government’s foresight in encouraging these plantations, the Allied armies have been abundantly supplied with all the rubber products they need—Germany and her allies have been cut off—and the price to the world at large has actually been reduced. Meanwhile leather has been getting •scarcer and more expensive—£0% higher than in 1914 —and the end is not yet

At normal prices a pair of good shoes cost about four times as much as a pair of rubbers—and would last twice as long if rubbers or overshoes were worn to protect them. Or a pair of heavy rubbers for the farm cost much less than heavy shoes, and would stand much more wear in had weather. So even before the war rubbers were a mighty good investment, to say nothing of their prevention of wet feet, colds and doctors’ bills.

DEPLETING POULTRY FLOCKS

Overloading of the Market Reducing the Price of Chickens.
Judging from the unprecedented heavy deliveries of poultry on the central eastern markets so early in the season, it would appear that farmers and producers generally are not only depleting their flocks unwarrantably but also rushing them to the market in an unfinished condition. As a result, the current price of chickens is much below normal value at the present time, in comparison with the prices of other meats. This is directly due to the overloading of the mar-

They must not spread or swell. If the former the oven is too cool; if the latter the oven is too hot. When baked remove them carefully from the pan, put the two flat sides together and place them on a sieve to cool.
Pans indented in the shape of lady-fingers are much less troublesome to, use than the pastry bay.
Jellied Chicken Consomme.—1*4 level tablespoonful granulated gelatine, 1 quart chicken stock, carefully strained and all fat removed ; juice of 1 lemon, beaten white and crushed shell of 1 egg, salt to taste.

Squash Delicacies
a

The squash and the pumpkin deserve n frequent place on the menu outside of thc traditional pie. It is true that they are both rather insipid vegetables by themselves, but as an accompaniment to some more spicy dish, or prepared properly, they are both ieheious and a welcome change from Hie more common vegetables.
For example, baked squash—cut in strips like a watermelon and bake until a light golden brown—is a delightful change from the baked potato or other starchy vegetable addition to meat.
Squash Souffle.—Two cupfuls of steamed mashed squash, one cupful of cream, two eggs, salt and pepper. Add the seasoning to the mashed steamed squash then add cream and the well-beaten whites of eggs, turn into a buttered baking dish and bake in slow oven.
Steamed Squash.—Cut in pieces, remove seeds and membrane and steam until tender—about thirty minutes. Mash, season with salt, a dash of sugar, mace and a lump of butter. Serve very hot.

The Duchess of Devonshire and Lady Anne Cavendish.
The Duke and Duchess of Devonshire have arrived in Canada to take up the great charge just relinquished by T.R.H. the Duke and Duchess of Connaught. To follow those who have made themselves so universally beloved is no easy task, but It is prophesied In England that the new Governor-General and hTk charming wife will quickly win our hearts. The Duchess of Devonshire, as a daughter of Lord Lansdowne, does not come to Canada as an entire stranger, since her distinguished father was Governor-General from 1883 to 1888, and then went on to India aa Viceroy, as did the late Lord Mm to.

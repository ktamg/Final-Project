The King's great kindness toxvanVi his soldiers and sympathy for their relatives has long been known, and more than once has he intervened to secure, in an urgent case, leave for some “Tommy" to visit his loved ones at home.
An incident of this character has just; come to light. It concerns a soldier who was refused leave to visit his dying mother, a Mrs. Thuey, who lives in Forest Gate, London.
She has four sons, all of them in the army, and Cecil, who is a corporal in the 2nd East Anglican Brigade, R. F.A., has been in France for three months. Recently the widow was seized with a dangerous illness, and craved for a sight of her boy Cecil.
Her daughter wrote, urging him to get leave and come home at once if

^PROGRESSIVE business methods, backed by forty-
five years of fair-dealing, have achieved for the Sun Life of Canada during 1915 records that are new in the Canadian life assurance field.
Assurances of over $34,000,000 issued and paid for in cash ; Totr.1 Assurances in Force of over $250,000,000; Total Payments to Policyholders since organization of more than $52,600,000 ; Assets in excess of $74,000,000; a Cash Income of nearly $16,000,000 and an Undistributed Net Surplus of over $7,500,000—all are high-water marks in the annals of Canadian life assurance.
Their achievement maintains the established prestige of the Sun Life of Canada as

A Mormon Major.
Whatever may be said of the beliefs of the Mormons in Canada, they don’t lack patriotism. When recruits were asked in the Mormon settlements in Alberta, many of the young Mormons rallied. Now, a squadron eomposed almost wholly of young "letter Day Saints" has been recruited at Cardston, the Mormon centre in Canada. The moving spirit was Major Hugh B Drown, a prominent official of the Mormon Church, now second in command of C Squadron, C. f) R., at Medicine Hat.
When the Alberta Rangers were organized in Alberta, some six years ago, the Mormon colonists were requested to muster a squadron. They did. Hugh Ii. Brown was one of the
a n
military school at Calgary, was gazetted a Captain. Captain Drown was a prominent figure at the annual summer camp at Calgary, and four years ago was made Major.
Major Brown comes by his military career "honestly on his father’s side of the house have been military men as far hack as the
great-grandfather, was a captain of artillery and fought in the war of 1812.—Canadian Courier.

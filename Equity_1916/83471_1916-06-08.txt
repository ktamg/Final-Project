The quaint little capes pvlerines, and similar fancies, of taffeta, faille, or satin, now being offered for summer wear, are other attractive additions to the summer frock ; in all probability these will be quite as popular as the fur stole, or the feather boa, or even a little more favored. They are becoming, quite in keeping with the dresses of the moment, may easily be fashioned at home, and are of course much less expensive than fur. Ruffles, cordings, and conventionalized trimings, quilled, pleated, pinked shirred, are used to finish these capes, lending still another old-fashioned touch

The testing department of the Conservatoire National ties Arts et Metiers of the French Republic made n highly scientiflc comparison between Ford constructive material and the material u**ed in another very noted and ex|>ensive car. In every test the Ford material proved superior.
The service given hy Ford car* in Quebec has fully substantiated the results obtained by these French scientists.
Huy a Ford, not only because its first cost is less, not alone because its maintenance cost is leas, but because its quality of service is greater,— because it gives more mileage jier dollar invested than any other make of car you can buy.
And if you want your Ford this summer, buy it today to ensure prompt delivery.

The 1916 Gray Dort sells for $850, yet it has the appearance and looks of a considerably more expensive car.
Electric starting, electric lighting, demountable rims, extra rim, gasoline gauge and speedometer on dash—and all those little conveniences that make motoring a pleasure are yours if you own a Gray Dort
50-inch cantilever springs and a perfect distribution of weight make the Gray Dort one of the easiest riding cars on the market.

improved by rolling with an ordinary land roller. In cases where the crust is forming, the roller will help to pulverize it and if the land is too loose it will pack the soil more closely around the seed and assist the germination. A great many growers roll their field three or four times after the crop starts to come up us it will never damage the beets when two or three inches high, and almost invariably improves the condition of the soil. It is particularly necessary to cultivate after each shower, so as to break the surface and thus conserve the moisture. This question of conserving soil moisture is a most important one for every farmer to understand. To grow the ordinary crop of roots or grain requires from 18 to 22 inches of water.
During the growing season the rain-I fall is usually about 10 to 12 inches.
It is necessary, therefore, to have stored in the sub-soil n large amount of water during the winter and early spring for the use of the crop in the dry monthe of the summer. Any 1 soil which is hard on top, pnrticul- i arly if it is inclined to crack will lose moisture very rapidly vhile in that condition. The careful farmer must keep a well cultivated mulch of three
or four inches on the surface to pre- greater profit to the manufacture and vent evaporation. This applies both to the industry.

Almost every woman ab the head of a home meets daily many little worries in her household affairs. They may be too small to notice an hour afterwards, but it is these same fit ant little worries that affect the blood and nerves and make women look prematurely old. Their effect may be noticed in sick or nervous headaches, fickle appetite, pain in the back or side, sallow complexion and the coming of wrinkles, which every woman dreads. To those thus afflicted Dr. Williams Pink Pills offer a speedy and certain cure; a restoration of color to the cheeks, brightness to the eye, a hearty appetite and a Ufnse of freedom from weariness.
Among the thousands of Canadian women who have found new health through Dr. Williams Pink Pills is Mrs. N. Worrall, lîroughdale, Ont., who says:—“After the birth of my second child I was so weak and run down that I was unable to do anything. The doctor said I had scarcely any blood in my body. I could not walk half a block without being completely exhausted and all the treatment of the doctor did not seem to help me. I called in another doctor, but with no better results. My feet and legs became frightfully swollen, I suffered with severe pains in my back and sides. I would be all day dragging around at my housework, and I was beginning to give up all hope of recovery. I had been urged to try

Fifty-one soldiers who have suffered perhaps the worst injury possible in war—blindness—have been taught to support themselves despite their handicap, at St. Dunstan’s Hostel, Regent’s Park, London, during the first year’s work of the institution. St Dunstan’s was donated by Otto Kahn of New York for this work.
The work has been largely done by the instruction of blind tutors, for it has been found that a newly blinded man is inspired to greater efforts under the supervision of a teacher similarly handicapped who undergoes the same difficulties and appreciates to the same degree the difficulty of the task.
The fifty-one men who left the hostel after receiving courses of instruction had learned one or more of the following occupations:	boot re-
pairing, mat making, net making, P. A. BONNOTS RHEUMATISM basket making, joinery, poultry farming nnd market gardening. In addition, typewriting, Braille shorthand and massaging are taught.

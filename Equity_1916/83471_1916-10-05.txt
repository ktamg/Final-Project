There are many reasons why the fall is the best time to paint. The fresh paint will not have the scorching heat of summer to contend with until well hardened. There are no spring rains and no flies or dust to settle in the fresh paint.

Mr. Horace Bcnford, leaving his work at the War Office, strolled thoughtfully through the dimmed streets on his way to see his fiancee, Miss Gladys Dayton.
“Dash it all!" he soliloquised. "I don't, know what to tell her. She's bound to make an awful fuss in any case. She’s like that. Affectionate and all that sort of thing, but a bit exacting! And she expects me to call every evening. And I certainly did promise to call last evening. There's going to be an awful fuss, and I shall be in the middle of it!"
further, he reflected bitterly, the whole blame lay on Dicky Saunders. What did Dicky Saunders want to come home on leave from the Front for, and go getting his friends into trouble? What did he want to go tempting friends into spending an evening at the theatre with him. and so causing them to break promises to their fiancees?

It is extraordinary difficult to know whether all the British shell fire and all the dead have yet begun to shake the confidence of the Germans in the strength of their war machine. Some of the officers who have come in as prisoners still keep their pride, writes a correspondent with the British Armies in the field. They have Keen the losses inflicted on them in and behind their lines, but say: “You can't beat us. We can't be beaten."
That is different from the old phrase: “We’re winning. Victory is certain for Germany," and it is a long way from the acknowledgment of defeat or possible defeat. There are times when the pessimists among us are tempted to think that the Germans have mysterious reserves of strength from which they can heal their wounds, and that the success gained is only local, and has not yet injured the German war machine in any vital part or struck a blow which has reached to the heart of the Ger-j man people.

Remove the toothpick and your sandwich is complete.

Vncleanvd Grain.
About 40 per cent, of the cleanings removed from grain at the Canadian terminal elevators consists of fine seeds capable of passing through a zinc screen containing perforations 1-14 inch in diameter. This means that 40,000 tons of small weed seeds are shipped in western grain each year, on which the grower pays the freight, and for which he gets no return. This represents a loss of a quarter of a million dollars which could be obviated if these fine seeds were removed before the grain is

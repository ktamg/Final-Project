Germany forbids the rale of spirits between V p m. and 9 a.m., and prohibits any sale to soldiers in uniform in Berlin or in the province of Brandenburg. Even wine and beer may not be sold bo soldiers at railroad stations or in the immediate vicinity.
In the field, some commanders permit, some forbid the liquor ration.
Great Britain forbids treating, and limits the hours of sale in certain areas. Conviction* for drunkenness in these areas fell off \'l per cent, in England and Wales, and 30 per cent, in Great Britain as a whole in the four week* after the order was established.

That Im What Makes People Pale, Weak and Languid.
The one source of most of the misery that affects men and women and growing children is poverty of the blood. If you consult a doctor he rays you are anaemic, which really means bloodless. That is what makes people drag'along, always tired, never real hungry, often unable to digest» their food, breathless after the slightest exertion, and too often on the verge of complete breakdown.
More weak, anaemic people have been made strong, energetic and cheerful by taking Dr. Williams Pink Pills than by any other means. These pills actually make new, rich blood which reaches every part of the body, strengthens the nerves and brings new health and strength. The following is proof of Dr. Williams Pink Pills tore-store health. Mr. Geo. Turner, New Haven, N.S., says:—“No doubt due to constant hard work I got in a badly run down condition. It took very little exertion to tire me, and my appetite was far from being good. Often I had headaches, and when going up stairs, or after any slight exertion my heart would palpitate violently, and I grew considerably alarmed about my condition. I decided to take Dr.
Williams Pink Pills and after using a few boxes 1 felt much better. I con- <*ril to marry without the permission
of the authorities.

I>ean Clarke, superintendent of the Toronto General Hospital, delivered a clever address to the Royal Cana-1 11 I "'"id iii'iH dian Institute recently in the Physics xalour ami vu building of Toronto University. Lec-ps v h" turing on the care and treatment of W'M'thx u| t!u* the criminal, he said that the methods of ascertaining the mentality of criminals are very Inadequate at present. Instead of undergoing a medical examination to determine the ^tate of Insanity, the fate of the criminal is ascertained after a legal r tight between the two attorneys. The crime and not the criminal receives t the most attention from the court. Canada is n century behind the time in criminology; she has welcomed all kinds of immigrants with open arms, but after the war lier eyes will he opened. Criminology will become an Important study, and the court will realize that criminals must be examined, then punished or treated according to the classification. There are moral imbeciles, Instinctive, occasional, habitual, and accidental criminals. Each one is distinctly different from the other classes. After The Duke of Devonshire will the law finally is brought to Ps
senses these degenerates will receive special treatment In proper Institutes and sanatoriums.

With the first, sultry days of summer, one naturally turns to white, or the pale-toned linens and cottons. Owing to the popularity of stripes and checks, it is safe to say that it will not be an all-white season, but allwhite is to be very popular, nevertheless.

German and Austrian newspapers coming to hand reflect the growing food shortage in Germany.
The Madgehurgische Volkastimme says that at a time when thousands of women are unable to put on the table a single piece of sausage it is infuriating to read in the Madgeburg-ische Zeitung the following advertisement:
“In my storehouse are 84 tons of sausage which has deteriorated in quality. To be sold by auction. May be viewed on Wednesday, 26th inst.”
Is it not revolting, asks the Volks-stimme, that it should be possible to allow over eight tons of sausage to spoil, and then offer them for sale?

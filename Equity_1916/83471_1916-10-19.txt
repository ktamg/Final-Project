There are many reasons why the fall is the best time to paint. The fresh paint will not have the scorching heat of summer to contend with until well hardened. There are no spring rains and no flies or dust to settle in the fresh paint.
Wo have a good stock of Paints, Varnishes, and

lustration is shown here, It shows the straighter effect and long lines * which Parisian houses have made a point of featuring this season. Long straps starting from the shoulders, under the large collar, and working j their way down on either side of the front, relieve the severity of this sim-1 pic design. Little slash pockets are placed on both the straps below the i belt line.
In some of the one-piece dresses, a long, narrow girdle of the material is wound loosely around the figure several times and tied at the back or front in a loose knot. The ends are often finisher with silk tasssels. The belt is generally arranged at the low waistline, giving a suggestion of the Moyen Age effect, which, it is predicted, will become popular again.
The materials most favored for these practical frocks are satin, broadcloth, fine serge, tricotine, fancy twills, gabardine and poplin. The Parisienne favors wool jersey very highly for these one-piece frocks, also the checked velours de laine which are considered so very smart. These materials are excellent for shopping, motoring and such occasions when one must be simply though smartly dressed. Some of the colors are dark brown, terra cotta, orange and green.
The combinations in checked velours are dark green with beige, gray with navy blue, and beige with Burgundy, not to speak of the black and white checks, which never seem to lose their popularity.
Skirls Are Longer and Stralghter
There is a decided tendency to longer and straighten-hanging skirts in most of the autumn models. Paquin has made many dresses noticeably longer, both for street and evening wear, and many of the other Perisian couturières have lengthened the skirts for the coming season, though not to an exaggerated degree. The skirts have not lost any of their fulness in their downward tendency. They simply follow the lines of the figure more closely and do not flare as much. The hoop skirts and crinoline effects are practically dead and some soft draperies are seen in their stead, especially in evening and afternoon dresses o 1 satins, crepes and soft silks.
These paterns may be obtained from your local McCall Dealer or from the McCall Company, 70 Bond Street, Toronto, Ontario.

GERMAN PRISONERS.
740;-m*s
Satin Dress Braided with Soutache
How the French Secure Them From
Running Away.
An American who fought with the French gives in the Atlantic Monthly a lively description of a successful attack on the enemy's trenches and the capture of many German prisoners:
Our line was wearing thin. Halfway to the third trench we were reinforced. The ground in our rear warn covered with our men. All at once came a change. The German artillery in front ceased firing, and the next 'second we saw the reason why. In the trench ahead the German troops were pouring out in black masses and advancing toward us at a trot. Was it a counter-attack? Then, as suddenly our own artillery ceased firing and the mystery became plain. The Germans were approaching in columns of four, officers to the front, hands held In the air; and as they came closer we could distinguish the steady cry, “Kameraden! Kameraden!"
They were surrendering. Out flew our knives, and in less time than it takes to tell it we had mingled among t^p prisoners, slicing off their trouser buttons, cutting off suspenders and hacking through belts. We cut the laces off all their shoes, and thus slopping along, their hands helplessly in their breeches pockets to keep their trousers from falling round their ankles, shuffling their feet to keep their boots on, the huge column of prisoners was sent to the rear with • few soldiers to direct rather than to guard them.
As the Germans had left trenches, their artillery had paused, thinking it a counter-atCack. Now, as file after file was escorted to the rear and it became apparent that the men had surrendered, the German artillery opened up again furiously. Six sheila landed at the same instant in almost the same place, and within s few minutes Section 8 of our had almost disappeared.

Reueeaau Though* 11 Might Come, but the Problem Slumped Him.
A furious Uttle book U» #n old, old tree the on aeronautics by Jcaa Jacques Itousxeuu. called “Le Nouveau Dédale.”
Like Leonardo da Vinci and Cyrano de Bergerac, Rousseau was haunted by the dream of aerial navigation. We read lu Ida treatise: “Men walk on the earth, they sail on the water and swim lu it. is not the air an element, like the others? Wluit business have the birds to shut us out of their prcmlhea while we are made welcome in thoee of the fishes?”
Rousseau took no stork In any theories propounded by the Darius Greens of his day. lie sifted the matter for himself and thought It Involved two problems. First, to find n body lighter than air, so tliat It would rise. He Imagined that sooner or later such a body might present Itself. There waa do telling.
But what stumped him was his second problem—how to moke that obligin': body stop rising and bow In creation to make it come down. This waa too tough a problem for Jeon Jacques, and be wound up bis book by admitting It
For a long time ”Le Nouveau Dedale” remained unpublished, appearing only In 180L

What Forest Fires Cost Canada in
the year 1916.
k


Canada has lost through forest fires in 1916 over nine million dollars. This equals more than six times what has been spent on forest protection work from coast to coast.
The enormous sum wasted through
this year’s forest fires most of which	, ,,	.	.
were preventive, would add another emarkable Story of the Man With
$480 to the first year’s pension allowances of nearly 19,000 Canadian soldiers.

BATTLEFIELD.
By the time of Queen Elizabeth the days of hoarding were near an end. The cannon had been improved until they were able to rend the enemy’s masts, yards and hull. The guns of largest size were eight feet long and 8% inches bore, and could send their projectiles a mile. Each ship car-When the gigantic “Queen Eliza- ! ried from 40 to 60 of these cannon, beth" class took the sea against the the broadside reaching as much as Germans, the British were but con- 400 pounds.

These culminated in Alfred’s “King’s ships," which the chronicler writes were “full nigh twice as long as the others." They were propelled by as , many as sixty oars.	|
King Canute produced what his people considered wonderful war- ! ships; in fact, the men of every period have been dazzled by the great men-o’-war of that period. These ships ranged from 100 to 200 feet | long, their sides were adorned with dragons’ and serpents' heads, their sails were painted in rainbow hues, and along their rails were rows of many-colored shields.

Formidable Fleets
The Stuart kings brought forth formidable fleets, consisting of vessels of different types, from pinnacles of less than 300 tons to the Sovereign of the Seas, the first British three-decker. She was a gorgeous affair, with decorations of carved angels and cupids covered with gilt, and she cost just $204,165, not counting the expense of her two hundred guns.
The warship in Stuart days did not depend entirely on her guns for punishing the enemy. We read of “arrows trimmed with wildfire to stick I in the sails or ship’s sides,” and “hollow brass halls and earthen pots covered with quarter bullets stuck in pitch, which, in a crowd of people, will make an incredible slaughter.”
Another step forward was taken with the “first rate” ship of about 1700, such as the Britannia, which carried 100 guns, from 6 pounds to I 78 pounds.

Reverend and Dear Sir :—All great joys are tinged with sadness. And this expresses our feelings on the occasion of your farewell visit to the parish and scenes of your early manhood. In these long since days Portage du Fort was an alive town with glowing prospects of u future. And the untiring efforts of the splendid and enthusiastic young rector was an inspiration to all.
Alas Î the years have worked many changes And few, if any, of your eon temporaries remain. But we who are here this evening welcome you with overflowing hearts, and appreciate the loyalty and affection that prompted you to take a long and wearying journey in order that you might celebrate your Diamond Jubilee with us in the old church. Your visit recalls to our memory many who have gone to join the Church Triumphant, and we know that when the day is far Apent, and the shadows ltegiit to fall, your saintly lips can say :
Lord, now let test Thou Thy servant depart in ;#eace.
We offer this our gift in gold ; it is pure and without dross, therefore appropriate and emblematic. We pray that your years may lie prolonged to a great old age, and that you will have the joy of celebrating the greatest victory that the world has ever known, when the tragedy of the age that i* being enacted on the blood-stained battlefields of Europe will have passed into history. Once more, farewell. And God be with you.
